AB  - Germline mutation at human minisatellite loci has been studied among
      children horn in heavily polluted areas of the Mogilev district of
      Belarus after the Chernobyl accident and in a control population.
      The frequency of mutation was found to be twice as high in the
      exposed families as in the control group. Mutation rate in the
      Mogilev families was correlated with the level of caesium-137
      surface contamination, consistent with radiation induction of
      germline mutation. [References: 31]

AB  - GALAXIES are surrounded by large haloes of hot gas(1) which must be
      replenished as the gas cools, This has led to the concept(2) of
      galactic 'chimneys'-cavities in the interstellar medium, created by
      multiple supernova explosions, that can act as conduits for the
      efficient transport of hot gas from a galaxy's disk to its halo.
      Here we present a high-resolution map of atomic hydrogen in the
      Perseus arm of our Galaxy, which shows clear evidence for the
      existence of such a chimney, This chimney appears to have been
      formed by the energetic winds from a cluster of young massive stars,
      and may currently have reached the stage of blowing out into the
      halo. [References: 27]

TI  - THE ORBITAL EVOLUTION OF THE ASTEROID EROS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR
      COLLISION WITH THE EARTH
SO  - Nature 1996 Apr 25;380(6576):689-691
AB  - THE population of asteroids that cross the Earth's orbit is
      responsible for most of the terrestrial impacts of kilometre-size
      objects, of which there may be several per million years(1). About
      150 Earth-crossing asteroids are known, although many more are
      thought to exist(2). Asteroids that come close to the Earth's orbit,
      but do not currently cross it, may also pose a threat if they evolve
      onto Earth crossing orbits. The asteroid 433 Eros, with a diameter
      of similar to 22 km and a perihelion of 1.13 AU (where 1 AU is the
      average distance of the Earth from the Sun), is the second-largest
      near-Earth asteroid(3). Here we report a study of the dynamical
      evolution of Eros's orbit over a period of two million years. We
      identify an orbital resonance with Mars that has the potential to
      perturb Mars-crossing asteroids, such as Eros, onto Earth-crossing
      orbits; of eight trial orbits that closely match Eros's present
      orbital parameters, three become Earth-crossing on the timescale of
      our simulations, and one of these hits the Earth after 1.14 Myr.
      Although our simulations indicate no significant danger of a
      catastrophic impact by this large near-Earth asteroid during the
      next similar to 10(5) years, such a collision is likely in the far
      future. [References: 15]

TI  - MANIPULATION OF AN ATOMIC BEAM BY A COMPUTER-GENERATED HOLOGRAM
SO  - Nature 1996 Apr 25;380(6576):691-694
MH  - Laser.  Radiation
AB  - TECHNIQUES for manipulating neutral atoms are valuable tools for the
      investigation of surfaces, acid hold promise for the fabrication of
      atomic structures for technological applications. The ability to
      position individual atoms with the accuracy of a crystal lattice
      constant has been demonstrated(1) using the scanning tunnelling
      microscope (STM). On the other hand, manipulation with lasers offers
      a means of controlling atoms in bulk, although it lacks the
      positional accuracy of the STM. The ability to generate ultra-cold
      atoms(2-5) using lasers has opened new possibilities: because of
      their long de Broglie wavelengths, cold atoms are amenable to
      interferometric manipulation, such as deflection by a grating(6,7)
      and focusing by a Fresnel lens(8). Here we demonstrate a potentially
      more flexible approach to atomic manipulation based on holographic
      principles. We pass a beam of ultra-cold metastable neon atoms
      through a computer-generated hologram that encodes the Fourier
      transform of a desired atomic pattern. Diffraction of the atomic
      beam by the hologram then reconstructs the pattern, in a manner
      analogous to optical holography. This approach should in principle
      enable the imposition of arbitrary intensity and phase information
      onto an atomic beam. [References: 11]

TI  - PHOTODEGRADATION OF METHYLMERCURY IN LAKES
SO  - Nature 1996 Apr 25;380(6576):694-697
MH  - Mercury.  Water.  Sediments.  Rates
AB  - METHYLMERCURY can accumulate in fish to concentrations that threaten
      human health(1). Fish methylmercury concentrations are high in many
      reservoirs(2) and acidic lakes(3), and also in many remote
      lakes(4,5)-a fact that may be related to increased atmospheric
      deposition of anthropogenically mobilized mercury during the past
      few decades(6). Although sources of methylmercury to lakes and
      reservoirs are known(7), in-lake destruction has not been
      demonstrated to occur at the low concentrations found in most water
      bodies. Here we report in situ incubations of lake water that show
      that methylmercury is decomposed by photo-degradation in surface
      waters. This process is abiotic and the rate is first-order with
      respect to methylmercury concentration and the intensity of solar
      radiation. In our study lake, the calculated annual rates of
      methylmercury photodegradation are almost double the estimated
      external inputs of methylmercury from rain, snow, streamflow and
      land runoff, implying the existence of a large source of
      methylmercury from bottom sediments. Photodegradation could also be
      an important process in the mercury cycle of other aquatic systems.
      This discovery fundamentally changes our understanding of aquatic
      mercury cycling, and challenges the long-accepted view that
      microbial demethylation dominates methylmercury degradation in
      natural fresh waters. [References: 24]

AB  - THE notion of a barren central Arctic Ocean has been accepted since
      English's pioneering work(1) on drifting ice-islands. The year-round
      presence of ice, a short photosynthetic season and low temperatures
      were thought to severely limit biological production(1,2), although
      the paucity of data was often noted. Because primary production
      appeared to be low(1,2), subsequent studies assumed that most
      organic carbon was either derived from river inputs or imported from
      adjacent continental-shelf regions(3,4). Here we present shipboard
      measurements of biological production, biomass and organic carbon
      standing-stocks made during a cruise through the ice covering the
      central Arctic Ocean. Our results indicate that the central Arctic
      region is not a biological desert. Although it is less productive
      than oligotrophic ocean regions not covered by ice, it supports an
      active biological community which contributes to the cycling of
      organic carbon through dissolved and particulate pools. [References:

SO  - Nature 1996 Apr 25;380(6576):699-702
MH  - Variability.  Cycle
AB  - THE Southern Ocean is the only oceanic domain encircling the globe.
      It contains the strong eastward flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar
      Current, acid is the unifying link for exchanges of water masses at
      all depths between the world's major ocean basins(1). As these
      exchanges are an important control on mean global climate, the
      Southern Ocean is expected to play an important role in transmitting
      climate anomalies around the globe. Interannual variability has been
      often observed at high southern latitudes, and observations of
      sea-ice extent suggest that such features propagate eastwards around
      the Southern Ocean(2,3). Here we use data from a variety of
      observational techniques to identify significant interannual
      variations in the atmospheric pressure at sea level, wind stress,
      sea surface temperature and sea-ice extent over the Southern Ocean.
      These anomalies propagate eastward with the circumpolar flow, with a
      period of 4-5 years and taking 8-10 years to encircle the pole. This
      system of coupled anomalies, which we call the Antarctic Circumpolar
      Wave, is likely to play an important role in climate regulation and
      dynamics both within and beyond the Southern Ocean. [References: 22]

MH  - Hard tissues.  Vertebrates.  Origin
AB  - THE first description of Anatolepis Bockelie & Fortey was from early
      Ordovician sediments of Ny Friesland, Spitsbergen(1,2), but the
      genus is now known from many localities in North America and
      Greenland, ranging in age hom the Late Cambrian period to the Early
      Ordovician(3-6). Although initially interpreted as an agnathan
      fish(2,3) that predated other representatives(7), this has been
      widely disputed because the available histological data were
      unconvincing(6,8-10) and the scales fell outside the known
      morphological range of other accepted early vertebrates(9-11).
      Further doubt was cast upon the vertebrate affinity of Anatolepis
      when specimens from East Greenland were interpreted as the cuticular
      fragments of aglaspid arthropods(6), although this interpretation
      has also been refuted(12). Here we report on the morphology and
      histology of large collections of Anatolepis, and demonstrate the
      presence of dentine, a tissue unique to vertebrates, confirming that
      the taxon is both a vertebrate and the oldest known fish.

MH  - Population-dynamics.  Patterns.  Number.  Length
AB  - BIOLOGICAL diversity, population size and body size are
      interdependent(1-8), but there is little consensus on the nature or
      causes of these relations. Here we analyse the most thoroughly
      sampled ecological community to date, a grassland insect community
      sample containing 89,596 individuals of 1,167 species. Each
      taxonomic order had a distinct body size at which both species
      richness and number of individuals were highest, but these peak
      sizes varied more than 100-fold among five major orders, These
      results suggest that there may be fewer undiscovered small insect
      species than previously thought. Moreover, we found a surprisingly
      strong, simple, but unreported, relation between species richness
      (S) and the number of individuals (I) within size classes, S =I-0.5.
      Because this held across numerous body types and a 100,000-fold
      body-size range, there may be a general rule that is independent of
      body size for the relations among interspecific resource division,
      abundance and diversity. [References: 31]

AB  - BASE-PAIR substitution rates for the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene
      of free-living, native populations of voles collected next to
      reactor 4 at Chernobyl, Ukraine, were estimated by two independent
      methods to be in excess of 10(-4) nucleotides per site per
      generation. These estimates are hundreds of times greater than those
      typically found in mitochondria of vertebrates, suggesting that the
      environment resulting from this nuclear power plant disaster is
      having a measurable genetic impact on the organisms of that region.
      Despite these DNA changes, vole populations thrive and reproduce in
      the radioactive regions around the Chernobyl reactor. [References:

MH  - Pole cell-formation.  Maternal gene.  Body pattern.  Embryo.  Plasm.
      Segmentation.  Anterior.  Oskar.  Anteroposterior.  Melanogaster
AB  - IN many animal groups, factors required for germline formation are
      localized in germ plasm(1), a region of the egg cytoplasm, In
      Drosophila embryos, germ plasm is located in the posterior pole
      region and is inherited in pole cells, the germline progenitors.
      Transplantation experiments have demonstrated that germ plasm
      contains factors that can form germline(2-4), and germ plasm also
      directs abdomen formation(5). Genetic analysis has shown that a
      common mechanism directs the localization of the abdomen and
      germline-forming factors to the posterior pole(6-12). The critical
      factor for abdomen formation is the nanos (nos) protein
      (nanos)(13-15). Here we show that nos is also essential for germline
      formation in Drosophila; pole cells lacking nanos activity fail to
      migrate into the gonads, and so do not become functional germ cells.
      In such pole cells, gene expression, which normally initiates within
      the gonad, begins prematurely during pole cell migration. Premature
      activation of genes in germline precursors may mean that these cells
      fail to develop normally. A function for nos protein in Drosophila
      germline formation is compatible with observations of its
      association with germ plasm in other animals(16-18). [References:

AB  - A STRIKING example of the relationship between regulation of
      transcription and phenotype is the central role of the Y-chromo
      somal gene Sry in mammalian sex determination(1,2). Sry is the
      founding member of a large family of so-called Sox genes(1,3).
      During murine embryogenesis, the transcriptional activator Sox-4 is
      expressed at several sites, hut in adult mice expression is
      restricted to immature B and T lymphocytes(4). Using targeted
      genedisruption, we have found that Sox-4(-/-) embryos succumb to
      circulatory failure at day E14. This was a result of impaired
      development of the endocardial ridges (a specific site of Sox-4
      expression) into the semilunar valves and the outlet portion of the
      muscular ventricular septum. The observed range of septation defects
      is known as 'common arterial trunk' in man. We studied haemopoiesis
      in lethally irradiated mice reconstituted with Sox-4(-/-) fetal
      liver cells acid found that a specific block occurred in B-cell
      development at the pro-B cell stage. In line with this, the
      frequency and proliferative capacity of IL-7-responsive B cell
      progenitors in fetal liver were severely decreased in vitro.

MH  - Hippocampus.  Amnesia
AB  - MEDIAL temporal lobe structures have been implicated in human
      episodic memory. Patients with medial temporal lesions show memory
      deficits(1-3), and functional neuroimaging studies have revealed
      activation in this region during episodic encoding and retrieval
      when data are averaged over a sample of subjects(4-7). The relevance
      of such observations for memory performance has remained unclear,
      however. Here we have used positron emission tomography (PET) to
      examine cerebral blood how related to verbal episodic retrieval. We
      observed strong positive correlations between retrieval and blood
      flow in left medial temporal structures in individual normal human
      subjects. In addition, multivariate analysis showed that regions in
      the left medial temporal lobe were dominant components of a pattern
      of brain regions that distinguished a high-retrieval condition from
      conditions of lower retrieval. These results suggest that medial
      temporal activity is related to retrieval success rather than
      retrieval attempt, possibly by reflecting reactivation of stored
      patterns. [References: 25]

SO  - Nature 1996 Apr 25;380(6576):717-720
AB  - REJECTION continues to be the single largest impediment to
      successful organ transplantation(1). Antilymphocyte globulin, which
      contains antibodies that react with the leukocyte common antigen
      known as CD45 (refs 2-6), has proved to be one of the most effective
      agents for preventing rejection. We have shown earlier that a
      monoclonal antibody directed against the RB isoform of CD45
      substantially inhibits the alloreactivity of human CD4(+)
      lymphocytes in vitro(7). Here we investigate whether CD45RB could be
      an appropriate target for preventing renal allograft rejection in
      mice. Mice treated with two injections of a monoclonal antibody
      (MB23G2) (ref. 8) raised against CD45RB protein all survived and had
      normal renal function. Furthermore, this antibody reversed acute
      rejection when therapy was delayed until day 4, and the mice
      survived for their natural lifespan. The immunosuppression achieved
      may find application in the prevention and treatment of transplant
      rejection in man. [References: 15]

AB  - THE L-selectin adhesion molecule is involved in guiding leukocytes
      to sites of inflammation(1). L-selectin is cleaved by an unusual
      proteolytic activity at a membrane-proximal site resulting in rapid
      shedding from the cell surface(2-7). Although it has been
      demonstrated that L-selectin mediates, in part, the early event of
      leukocyte rolling under hydrodynamic flows(8-10), the contribution
      of shedding to L-selectin function has remained unknown. Here we
      show that hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitors block
      L-selectin downregulation from the cell surface of stimulated
      neutrophils, without affecting Mac-1 mobilization or general
      neutrophil activation, and inhibit cleavage of L-selectin in a
      cell-free system. Unexpectedly, the hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors
      reduced neutrophil rolling velocity under hydrodynamic flow,
      resulting in increased neutrophil accumulation. These results
      suggest that L-selectin is cleaved in seconds-much faster than

      significantly to the velocity of leukocyte rolling, L-selectin

TI  - SEQUENTIAL ACTIVATION OF ICE-LIKE AND CPP32-LIKE PROTEASES DURING
      FAS-MEDIATED APOPTOSIS
SO  - Nature 1996 Apr 25;380(6576):723-726
AB  - BINDING of Fas ligand or an agonistic anti-Fas antibody induces
      apoptosis in Fas-bearing cells(1). The interleukin-1 beta-converting
      enzyme (ICE) is a cysteine protease(2) that is involved in apoptosis
      induced by various stimuli, including Fas-mediated apoptosis(3-8).
      Several ICE homologues have been identified, and these are
      subdivided into three groups (ICE-, CPP32- and Ich-1-like
      proteases)(9-18). We show here that specific inhibitors of ICE- or
      CPP32-like proteases can inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis. Transient
      ICE-like activity was found in the cytosolic fraction of
      Fas-activated cells, whereas ICE-dependent, CPP32-like activity
      gradually accumulated in the cytosol. Cell lysates from mouse
      lymphoma supplemented with either recombinant ICE or CPP32 induced
      apoptosis of nuclei. The CPP32 inhibitor inhibited ICE- or
      CPP32-induced apoptosis in the cell-free system, whereas the
      ICE-inhibitor only inhibited ICE-induced apoptosis. Cell extracts
      from thymocytes from ICE-null mice induced apoptosis in the
      cell-free system when it was supplemented with CPP32. These results
      indicate that Fas sequentially activates ICE- and CPP32-like
      proteases, and that downstream CPP32, together with a component(s)
      in the cytoplasm, causes apoptosis of nuclei. [References: 30]

AB  - FOR life to be sustained, mistakes in DNA repair must be tolerated
      when damage obscures the genetic information. In bacteria such as
      Escherichia coli, DNA damage elicits the well regulated 'SOS
      response' (reviewed in ref. 1). For the extreme case of damage that
      cannot be repaired by conventional enzymes, there are proteins that
      allow the replication of DNA through such lesions, but with a
      reduction in the fidelity of replication(2). Essential proteins in
      this mutagenic process are RecA, DNA polymerase III, UmuD, UmuD' and
      UmuC (umu: UV mutagenesis)(1-3). Regulation of this response
      involves a RecA-mediated self-cleavage of UmuD to produce UmuD'. To
      understand this system in more detail, we have determined the
      crystal structure of the E. coli UmuD' mutagenesis protein at 2.5
      Angstrom resolution. Globular heads folded in an unusual
      beta-structure associate to form molecular dimers, and extended
      amino-terminal tails associate to produce crystallized filaments.
      The structure provides insight into the mechanism of the
      self-cleavage reaction that UmuD-like proteins undergo as part of
      the global SOS response(4-8). [References: 30]

      PROTEIN SEQUENCE
SO  - Nature 1996 Apr 25;380(6576):730-734
MH  - Different conformations.  Pentapeptides
AB  - PROTEIN secondary structures have been viewed as fundamental
      building blocks for protein folding, structure and design. Previous
      studies indicate that the propensities of individual amino acids to
      form particular secondary structures are the result of a combination
      of local conformational preferences(1,2) and non-local factors(3-7).
      To examine the extent to which non-local factors influence the
      formation of secondary structural elements, we have designed an
      11-amino-acid sequence (dubbed the 'chameleon' sequence) that folds
      as an alpha-helix when in one position but as a beta-sheet when in
      another position of the primary sequence of the IgG-binding domain
      of protein G (GB1). Both proteins, chameleon-alpha and
      chameleon-beta, are folded into structures similar to native GB1, as
      judged hy several biophysical criteria. Our results demonstrate that
      non-local interactions can determine the secondary structure of
      peptide sequences of substantial length. They also support views of
      protein folding that favour tertiary interactions as dominant
      determinants of structure (for example, see refs 8,9). [References:

      extent of local growth rates. Here, it is demonstrated that
      synpolydactyly, an inherited human abnormality of the hands and
      feet, is caused by expansions of a polyalanine stretch in the
      amino-terminal region of HOXD13. The homozygous phenotype includes
      the transformation of metacarpal and metatarsal bones to short
      carpal- and tarsal-like bones. The mutations identify the
      polyalanine stretch outside of the DNA binding domain of HOXD13 as a
      region necessary for proper protein function. [References: 26]

AB  - We have isolated and characterized a cDNA and the gene of the human
      homologue of CAAF1, a novel member of the S100 calcium-binding
      protein family. The 276-bp open reading frame encoded a 92-amino
      acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 10,575 Da. The
      deduced amino acid sequence of human CAAF1 showed 66% homology to
      bovine CAAF1. The human CAAF1 gene consisted of three exons, with
      the two EF hand motifs of the CAAF1 protein separately encoded by
      exons 2 and 3. This gene was expressed at a high level in
      polymorphonuclear leukocytes and at an intermediate level in
      esophageal mucosa. The tissue distribution of CAAF1 mRNA was
      different from that of other S100 proteins. Direct R-banding
      fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the human CAAF1
      gene was mapped to chromosome 1q21.2-q22, where most of the S100
      genes form a cluster. (C) 1996 Academic Press Inc. [References: 15]

AB  - Among pathogenic micro-organisms that evade the mammalian immune
      responses, Trypanosoma brucei has developed the most elaborate
      capacity for antigenic variation, Trypanosomes branched early during
      eukaryotic evolution. They are characterized by many aberrations,
      ranging from the unusual compartmentation of metabolic pathways to
      the heresy of RNA editing. The ubiquitous phenomenon of
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchoring of eukaryotic plasma membrane
      proteins and RNA trans-splicing (trypanosome genes contain no
      introns), which adds an identical leader sequence to all trypanosome
      mRNAs, were first defined during studies of antigenic variation.
      Genetic transformation of trypanosomes and the high efficiency of
      gene targeting provide new opportunities to investigate the
      regulation of antigenic variation. There is every reason to expect
      trypanosomes to provide further surprises and insights into the
      evolution of genetic regulatory mechanisms. [References: 77]

AB  - Sector boundary analysis has been used to deduce the number and
      orientation of cells initiating flower and floral organ development
      in Arabidopsis thaliana. Sectors were produced in transgenic plants
      carrying the Ac transposon from maize inserted between the
      constitutive 35S promoter and the GUS reporter gene, Excision of the
      transposon results in a blue-staining sector, Plants were chosen in
      which an early arising sector passed from vegetative regions into
      the inflorescence and through a mature flower. The range of sector
      boundary positions seen in mature flowers indicated that flower
      primordia usually arise from a group of four cells on the
      inflorescence flank, The radial axes of the mature flower are
      apparently set by these cells, supporting the concept that they act
      as a structural template, Floral organs show two patterns of
      initiation, a leaf-like pattern with eight cells in a row (sepals
      and carpels), or a shout-like pattern with four cells in a block
      (stamens), The petal initiation pattern involved too few cells to
      allow assignment, The numbers of initiating cells were close to
      those seen when organ growth commenced in each case, indicating that
      earlier specification of floral organ development does not occur, By
      examining sector boundaries in homeotic mutant flowers in which
      second whorl organs develop as sepal-like organs rather than petals,
      we have shown that their pattern of origin is position dependent
      rather than identity dependent. [References: 36]

AB  - Using gene targeting in mice, we have undertaken a systematic
      mutational analysis of the homeobox-containing 5' HoxD genes, In
      particular, we have characterized the limb defects observed in mice
      with independent targeted disruptions of hoxd-12 and hoxd-13.
      Animals defective for hoxd-12 are viable, fertile, and appear
      outwardly normal yet have minor autopodal defects in the forelimb
      which include a reduction in the bone length of metacarpals and
      phalanges, and a malformation of the distal carpal bone d4, The limb
      phenotypes observed in hoxd-13 mutant mice are more extensive,
      including strong reductions in length, complete absences, or
      improper segmentations of many metacarpal and phalangeal bones,
      Additionally, the d4 carpal bone is not properly formed and often
      produces an extra rudimentary digit, To examine the genetic
      interactions between the 5' HoxD genes, we bred these mutant strains
      with each other and with our previously characterized horn-Il mouse
      to produce a series of trans-heterozygotes, Skeletal analyses of
      these mice reveal that these genes interact in the formation of the
      vertebrate limb, since the trans-heterozygotes display phenotypes
      not present in the individual heterozygotes, including more severe
      carpal, metacarpal and phalangeal defects, Some of these phenotypes
      appear to be accounted for by a delay in the ossification events in
      the autopod, which lead to either the failure of fusion or the
      elimination of cartilaginous elements, Characteristically, these
      mutations Lead to the overall truncation of digits II and V on the
      forelimb, Additionally, some trans-animals show the growth of an
      extra postaxial digit VI, which is composed of a bony element
      resembling a phalange. The results demonstrate that these genes
      interact in the formation of the limb, In addition to the previously
      characterized paralogous interactions, a multitude of interactions
      between Hox genes is used to finely sculpt the forelimb, The 5' Hox
      genes could therefore act as a major permissive genetic milieu that
      has been exploited by evolutionary adaptation to form the tetrapod
      limbs. [References: 44]

AB  - Hedgehog genes have been implicated in inductive signaling during
      development in a variety of organisms, A key element of the hedgehog
      signaling system is encoded by the gene patched, In Drosophila
      hedgehog regulates gene expression by antagonizing the action of
      patched, In addition, patched is itself a transcriptional target of
      hedgehog signaling,

      We have isolated a chicken patched homolog and find it to be
      strongly expressed adjacent to all tissues where members of the
      hedgehog family are expressed, As in Drosophila, ectopic expression
      of Sonic hedgehog leads to ectopic induction of chicken Patched,
      Based on this regulatory conservation, vertebrate Patched is likely
      to be directly downstream of Sonic hedgehog signaling,

      An important role of Sonic hedgehog is the regulation of
      anterior/posterior pattern in the developing limb bud, Since Patched
      is directly downstream of the hedgehog signal, the extent of high
      level Patched expression provides a measure of the distance that
      Sonic hedgehog diffuses and directly acts, On this basis, we find
      that Sonic hedgehog directly acts as a signal over only the
      posterior third of the limb bud,

      During limb patterning, secondary signals are secreted in both the
      mesoderm (e.g. Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2) and apical ectodermal
      ridge (e.g. Fibroblast Growth Factor-4) in response to Sonic
      hedgehog, Thus knowing which is the direct target tissue is
      essential for unraveling the molecular patterning of the limb, The
      expression of Patched provides a strong indication that the mesoderm
      and not the ectoderm is the direct target of Sonic hedgehog
      signaling in the limb bud,

      Finally we demonstrate that induction of Patched requires Sonic
      hedgehog but, unlike Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 and Hox genes,
      does not require Fibroblast Growth Factor as a co-inducer. It is
      therefore a more direct target of Sonic hedgehog than previously
      reported patterning genes. [References: 43]

AB  - Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a cytokine known to influence
      proliferation and/or survival of mouse primordial germ cells (PGC)
      in culture, The receptor complex for LIF comprises LIF-binding
      subunit and non-binding signal transducer, gp130, The gp130 was
      originally identified as a signal-transducing subunit of interleukin
      (IL)-6 and later also found to be a functional component of receptor
      complexes for other LIF-related cytokines (oncostatin M [OSM],
      ciliary neurotrophic factor [CNTF] and IL-11), In this study, we
      have analyzed the functional role of gp130-mediated signaling in PGC
      growth in vitro, OSM was able to fully substitute for LIF; both
      cytokines promoted the proliferation of migratory PGC (mPGC) and
      enhanced the viability of postmigratory (colonizing) PGC (cPGC) when
      cultured on SI/S4(4)-m220 cells, Interestingly, IL-11 stimulated
      mPGC growth comparable to LIF and OSM, but did not affect cPGC
      survival, IL-6 and CNTF did not affect PGC. In addition, a
      combination of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 binding subunit (sIL-6R), which
      is known to activate intracellular signaling via gp130, fully
      reproduced the LIF action on PGC, Both in the presence and absence
      of LIF, addition of neutralizing antibody against gp130 in culture
      remarkably blocked cPGC survival, These results suggest a pivotal
      role of gp130 in PGC development, especially that it is
      indispensable for cPGC survival as comparable to the c-KIT-mediated
      action, We have further demonstrated that a combination of LIF with
      forskolin or retinoic acid, a potent mitogen for PGC, supported the
      proliferation of PGC, leading to propagation of the embryonic stem
      cell-like cells, termed embryonic germ (EG) cells, Since EG cells
      were also obtained by using OSM or the IL-6/sIL-6R complex in place
      of LIF, a significant contribution of gp130-mediated signaling in EG
      cell formation was further suggested. [References: 58]

      respectively. Northern blot analysis showed the presence of an mRNA
      of 3.4 kb which suggests that the cDNA sequence is close to full

AB  - The yeast two-hybrid system was used to isolate novel cellular
      factors that interact with the mouse peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha). One of the
      interacting clones isolated encoded LXR alpha, a recently described
      human orphan nuclear hormone receptor. LXR alpha bound directly to
      PPAR alpha, as well as to the common heterodimerization partner
      9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR alpha). LXR alpha did not form a
      DNA binding complex with PPAR alpha on synthetic hormone response
      elements composed of direct repeats of the TGACCT consensus
      half-site or on naturally occurring peroxisome proliferator response
      elements (PPREs) or LXR alpha response elements, However, LXR alpha
      inhibited binding of PPAR alpha/RXR alpha heterodimers to PPREs, and
      coexpression of LXR alpha in mammalian cells antagonized peroxisome
      proliferator signaling mediated by PPAR alpha/RXR alpha in vivo,
      These findings identify a novel partner for PPAR alpha and suggest
      that LXR alpha plays a role in modulating PPAR-signaling pathways in
      the cell. [References: 28]

AB  - Compartmentalization of the type II cyclic AMP-dependent kinase
      (PKA) is achieved through association of the regulatory subunit
      (RII) with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), Using an interaction
      cloning strategy with RII alpha as a probe, we have isolated cDNAs
      encoding a novel 1129-amino acid protein that contains both a PKA
      binding region and a peroxisome targeting motif. Northern analysis
      detected mRNAs of 9.7 and 7.3 kb in several rat tissues with the
      highest levels present in the brain and testis, Western analysis and
      RII overlay experiments showed that the protein is approximately 220
      kDa and was, therefore, named AKAP 220. Immunoprecipitation of AKAP
      220 from rat testis extracts resulted in co-purification of the type
      II PKA holoenzyme, The specific activity of PKA increased 458-fold
      from 7.2 pmol/min/mg in the cell lysate to 3.3 nmol/min/mg in the
      immunoprecipitate. Immunohistochemical analysis of rat testicular
      TM4 cells showed that AKAP 220 and a proportion of RII were
      co-localized in microbodies that appear to be a subset of
      peroxisomes. Collectively, these results suggest that AKAP 220 may
      play a role in targeting type II PKA for cAMP-responsive peroxisomal
      events. [References: 47]

AB  - Peripheral nerve damage causes a dramatic alteration to the gene
      expression in primary sensory neurons, changes within the neuronal
      cell body giving rise to an altered phenotype, adapted for axonal
      regeneration. Such changes suggest an alteration in activity, or
      levels, of cellular transcription factors. The POU family
      transcription factor Oct-2 is known to be induced in sensory neurons
      by nerve growth factor (NGF) and might therefore be affected by the
      removal of target-derived NGF following axotomy. Paradoxically,
      however, the expression of Oct-2 showed a transient increase of two-
      to three-fold 24 h after axotomy. In contrast, axotomy had no effect
      on the levels of the Brn-3 sub-family of POU proteins, indicating
      that this effect was specific for Oct-2. [References: 27]

AB  - Several patients have been described recently who suffer from a
      non-rhizomelic type of chondrodysplasia punctata (CDP), but who show
      all the biochemical abnormalities characteristic of the rhizomelic
      form of chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), a peroxisomal disorder. We
      have used protease protection experiments and microinjection of
      reporter-protein-encoding expression plasmids to show that
      peroxisomal thiolase fails to be imported into peroxisomes in cells
      from non-rhizomelic CDP patients, as has already been found in cells
      from classical RCDP patients. Furthermore, complementation analysis
      after somatic cell fusion indicates that the non-rhizomelic CDP
      patients are impaired in the same gene as classical RCDP patients.
      We conclude that defects in a single gene can give rise to both
      clinical phenotypes. [References: 20]

AB  - Oral administration of the adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone
      (DHEA), a peroxisome proliferator and hepatocarcinogen in the rat,
      caused an increase in NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation in
      microsomes isolated from rat liver and kidney cortex, but not from
      brain. The increase of liver microsomal lipid peroxidation was
      greater in male than in female rats. The effect of DHEA on lipid
      peroxidation became discernible after feeding steroid-containing
      diet (0.6%) to male and female rats for 2 and 3 days and reached
      maximal levels at 1 and 2 weeks, respectively. The increase of
      microsomal lipid peroxidation reached a plateau stimulation at 0.05%
      in the diet. The addition of DHEA in the concentration range 0.1-100
      mu M to microsomes isolated from control rats had no effect on lipid
      peroxidation. Furthermore, a significant increase of the endogenous
      concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances was found
      in microsomes after DHEA-administration at 0.05% in the diet. These
      results provide in vivo evidence that DHEA can cause lipid
      peroxidation in rat liver. Administration of DHEA at 0.6% in the
      diet for 7 consecutive days also significantly enhanced NADH- and
      ascorbate-dependent lipid peroxidation in liver microsomes. The
      DHEA-stimulated rat liver microsomal lipid peroxidation was
      completely inhibited by EDTA but not by superoxide dismutase,
      catalase or mannitol applied as OH-radical scavenger. The findings
      indicate that membrane lipid peroxidation is an early effect of
      DHEA, and that this process may be involved in the steroid-induced
      carcinogenesis in rats. [References: 38]

AB  - Peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA; EC 1.8.4.6) is a
      ubiquitous protein that can reduce methionine sulfoxide residues in
      proteins as well as in a large number of methyl sulfoxide compounds,
      The expression of MsrA in various rat tissues was determined by
      using immunocytochemical staining. Although the protein was found in
      all tissues examined, it,vas specifically localized to renal medulla
      and retinal pigmented epithelial cells, and it was prominent in
      neurons and throughout the nervous system. In addition, blood and
      alveolar macrophages showed high expression of the enzyme, The msrA
      gene was mapped to the central region of mouse chromosome 14, in a
      region of homology with human chromosomes 13 and 8p21. [References:

AB  - In addition to the five 70-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70) common to
      germ cells and somatic tissues of mammals, spermatogenic cells
      synthesize HSP70-2 during meiosis, To determine if this unique
      stress protein has a critical role in meiosis, we used
      gene-targeting techniques to disrupt Hsp70-2 in mice. Male mice
      homozygous for the mutant allele (Hsp70-2(-/-)) did not synthesize
      HSP70-2, lacked postmeiotic spermatids and mature sperm, and were
      infertile, However, neither meiosis nor fertility was affected in
      female Hsp70-2(-/-) mice, We previously found that HSP70-2 is
      associated with synaptonemal complexes in the nucleus of meiotic
      spermatocytes from mice and hamsters. While synaptonemal complexes
      assembled in Hsp70-2(-/-) spermatocytes, structural abnormalities
      became apparent in these cells by late prophase, and development
      rarely progressed to the meiotic divisions, Furthermore, analysis of
      nuclei and genomic DNA indicated that the failure of meiosis in
      Hsp70-2(-/-) mice was coincident with a dramatic increase in
      spermatocyte apoptosis. These results suggest that HSP70-2
      participates in synaptonemal complex function during meiosis in male
      germ cells and is linked to mechanisms that inhibit apoptosis.

AB  - During metamorphosis of Drosophila melanogaster, a cascade of
      morphological changes is triggered by the steroid hormone 20-OH
      ecdysone via the ecdysone receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor
      superfamily, In this report, we have transferred insect hormone
      responsiveness to mammalian cells by the stable expression of a
      modified ecdysone receptor that regulates an optimized ecdysone
      responsive promoter. Inductions reaching 4 orders of magnitude have
      been achieved upon treatment with hormone, Transgenic mice
      expressing the modified ecdysone receptor can activate an integrated
      ecdysone responsive promoter upon administration of hormone. A
      comparison of tetracyline-based and ecdysone-based inducible systems
      reveals the ecdysone regulatory system exhibits lower basal activity
      and higher inducibility. Since ecdysone administration has no
      apparent effect on mammals, its use for regulating genes should be
      excellent for transient inducible expression of any gene in
      transgenic mice and for gene therapy. [References: 21]

AB  - Adenovirus (Ad) vectors have been extensively used to deliver
      recombinant genes to a great variety of cell types in vitro and in
      vivo, Ad-based vectors are available that replace the Ad early
      region 1 (El) with recombinant foreign genes. The resultant
      El-deleted vectors can then be propagated on 293 cells, a human
      embryonal kidney cell line that constitutively expresses the EI
      genes. Unfortunately, infection of cells and tissues in vivo results
      in low-level expression of Ad early and late proteins (despite the
      absence of El activity) resulting in immune recognition of virally
      infected cells. The infected cells are subsequently eliminated,
      resulting in only a transient expression of foreign genes in vivo,
      We hypothesize that a second-generation Ad vector with a deletion of
      viral genes necessary for Ad genome replication should block viral
      DNA replication and decrease viral protein production, resulting in
      a diminished immune response and extended duration of foreign gene
      expression in vivo, As a first step toward the generation of such a
      modified vector, we report the construction of cell lines that not
      only express the EI genes but also constitutively express the Ad
      serotype 2 140-kDa DNA polymerase protein, one of three virally
      encoded proteins essential for Ad genome replication. The Ad
      polymerase-expressing cell lines support the replication and growth
      of H5ts36, an Ad with a temperature-sensitive mutation of the Ad
      polymerase protein. These packaging cell lines can be used to
      prepare Ad vectors deleted for the El and polymerase functions,
      which should facilitate development of viral vectors for gene
      therapy of human diseases. [References: 29]

AB  - Complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35) and complement receptor 2 (CR2,
      CD21) have been implicated as regulators of B-cell activation, We
      explored the role of these receptors in the development of humoral
      immunity by generating CR1- and CR2-deficient mice using
      gene-targeting techniques. These mice have normal basal levels of
      IgM and of IgG isotypes. B- and T-cell development are overtly
      normal, Nevertheless, B-cell responses to low and high doses of a
      T-cell-dependent antigen are impaired,pith decreased titers of
      antigen-specific IgM and IgG isotypes. This defect is not complete
      because there is still partial activation of B lymphocytes during
      the primary immune response, with generation of splenic germinal
      centers and a detectable, although reduced, secondary antibody
      response. These data suggest that certain T-dependent antigens
      manifest an absolute dependence on complement receptors for the
      initiation of a normally robust immune response. [References: 34]

AB  - The CBFA2 (AML1) gene encodes a DNA-binding subunit of the
      heterodimeric core-binding factor, The CBFA2 gene is disrupted by
      the (8;21), (3;21), and (12;21) chromosomal translocations
      associated with leukemias and myelodysplasias in humans, Mice
      lacking a CBF alpha 2 protein capable of binding DNA die between
      embryonic days 11.5 and 12.5 due to hemorrhaging in the central
      nervous system (CNS), at the nerve/CNS interfaces of cranial and
      spinal nerves, and in somitic/intersomitic regions along the
      presumptive spinal cord, Hemorrhaging is preceded by symmetric,
      bilateral necrosis in these regions, Definitive erythropoiesis and
      myelopoiesis do not occur in Cbfa2-deficient embryos, and disruption
      of one copy of the Cbfa2 gene significantly reduces the number of
      progenitors for erythroid and myeloid cells. [References: 48]

AB  - High-level globin-expression in erythroid precursor cells depends on
      the integrity of NF-E2 recognition sites, transcription factor
      AP-1-like protein-binding motifs, located in the upstream regulatory
      regions of the alpha- and beta-globin loci, The NF-E2 transcription
      factor, which recognizes these sites, is a heterodimer consisting of
      (i) p45 NF-E2 (the larger subunit), a hematopoietic-restricted basic
      leucine zipper protein, and (ii) a widely expressed basic leucine
      zipper factor, p18 NF-E2, the smaller subunit, p18 NF-E2 protein
      shares extensive homology with the maf protooncogene family, To
      determine an in vivo role for p18 NF-E2 protein me disrupted the p18
      NF-E2-encoding gene by homologous recombination in murine embryonic
      stem cells and generated p18 NF-E2(-/-) mice, These mice are
      indistinguishable from littermates throughout all phases of
      development and remain healthy in adulthood, Despite the absence of
      expressed p18 NF-E2, DNA-binding activity with the properties of the
      NF-E2 heterodimer is present in fetal liver erythroid cells of p18
      NF-E2(-/-) mice, We speculate that another member of the maf basic
      leucine zipper family substitutes for the p18 subunit in a complex
      with p45 NF-E2. Thus, p18 NF-E2 per se appears to be dispensable in
      vivo. [References: 31]

AB  - Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinase is currently
      used as a suicide agent in the gene therapy of cancer, This therapy
      is based on the preferential phosphorylation of nucleoside analogs
      by tumor cells expressing HSV 1 thymidine kinase, However, the use
      of HSV-1 thymidine kinase is limited in part by the toxicity of the
      nucleoside analogs, We have used random sequence mutagenesis to
      create new HSV-1 thymidine kinases that, compared with wild-type
      thymidine kinase, render cells much more sensitive to specific
      nucleoside analogs, A segment of the HSV-1 thymidine kinase gene at
      the putative nucleoside binding site was substituted with random
      nucleotide sequences, Mutant enzymes that demonstrate preferential
      phosphorylation of the nucleoside analogs, ganciclovir or acyclovir,
      were selected from more than one million Escherichia coli
      transformants, Among the 426 active mutants we have isolated, 26
      demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to ganciclovir, and 54 were more
      sensitive to acyclovir, Only 6 mutant enzymes displayed sensitivity
      to both ganciclovir and acyclovir when expressed in E. coli,
      Analysis of 3 drug-sensitive enzymes demonstrated that 1 produced
      stable mammalian cell transfectants that are 43-fold more sensitive
      to ganciclovir and 20-fold more sensitive to acyclovir. [References:

AB  - In somatic mammalian cells, homologous recombination is a rare
      event, To study the effects of chromosomal breaks on frequency of
      homologous recombination, site-specific endonucleases were
      introduced into human cells by electroporation. Cell lines with a
      partial duplication within the HPRT (hypoxanthine
      phosphoribosyltransferase) gene were created through gene targeting,
      Homologous, intrachromosomal recombination between the repeated
      regions of the gene can reconstruct a functioning, wild-type gene.
      Treatment of these cells with the restriction endonuclease Xba I,
      which has a recognition site within the repeated region of NPRT
      homology, increased the frequency of homologous recombination by
      more than 10-fold, Recombination frequency was similarly increased
      by treatment with the rare-cutting yeast endonuclease PI-See I when
      a cleavage site was placed within the repeated region of HPRT, In
      contrast, four restriction enzymes that cut at positions either
      outside of the repeated regions or between them produced no change
      in recombination frequency, The results suggest that homologous
      recombination between intrachromosomal repeats can be specifically
      initiated by a double-strand break occurring within regions of
      homology, consistent with the predictions of a
      double-strand-break-repair model. [References: 37]

MH  - Nucleotide-sequence.  Messenger-rna.  Rapeseed.  Gene.  Performance
AB  - The amino acid sequences of a number of closely related proteins
      (''napin'') isolated from Brassica napus were determined by mass
      spectrometry without prior separation into individual components.
      Some of these proteins correspond to those previously deduced (napA,
      BngNAP1, and gNa), chiefly from DNA sequences. Others were found to
      differ to a varying extent (BngNAP1', BngNAP1A, BngNAP1B, BngNAP1C,
      gNa', and gNaA), The short chains of gNa and gNa' and of BngNAP1 and
      BngNAP1' differ by the replacement of N-terminal proline by
      pyroglutamic acid; the long chains of gNaA and BngNAP1B contain a
      six amino acid stretch, MQGQQM, which is present in gNa (according
      to its DNA sequence) but absent from BngNAP1 and BngNAP1C, These
      alternations of sequences between napin isoforms are most likely due
      to homologous recombination of the genetic material, but some of the
      changes may also be due to RNA editing, The amino acids that follow
      the untruncated C termini of those napin chains for which the DNA
      sequences are known (napA, BngNAP1, and gNa) are aromatic amino
      acids, This suggests that the processing of the proprotein leading
      to the C termini of the two chains is due to the action of a
      protease that specifically cleaves a G/S-F/Y/W bond. [References:

TI  - TARGETED DISRUPTION OF THE MOUSE APOBEC-1 GENE ABOLISHES
      APOLIPOPROTEIN B MRNA EDITING AND ELIMINATES APOLIPOPROTEIN B48

AB  - A site-specific C to U editing reaction modifies nuclear
      apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) mRNA, producing apolipoprotein B48 in
      the mammalian small intestine, This reaction is mediated by a
      multicomponent enzyme complex, which contains a catalytic subunit,
      Apobec-1. We have used gene targeting to disrupt mouse apobec-1 in
      order to establish its requisite importance in apoB mRNA editing and
      also, in view of its widespread tissue distribution in rodents, as a
      preliminary indication of other potential roles. Both heterozygous
      (apobec-1(+/-)) and homozygous (apobec-1(-/-)) gene-targeted mice
      appear healthy and fertile with no alterations in serum cholesterol
      or triglyceride concentrations. The apobec-1(+/-) mice demonstrated
      reduced levels of hepatic apoB mRNA editing. By contrast, levels of
      small intestinal apoB mRNA editing were indistinguishable in
      wild-type and apobec-1(+/-) animals, suggesting that Apobec-1 is
      expressed in limited quantities in the liver but not in the small
      intestine. The apobec-1(-/-) mice lacked detectable levels of
      Apobec-1 mRNA, expressed only unedited apoB mRNA in all tissues, and
      contained no apoB48 in their serum, demonstrating that there is no
      functional duplication of this gene. [References: 30]

AB  - When glucose-starved cells are replenished with glucose, the key
      gluconeogenic enzyme, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), is
      selectively targeted from the cytosol to the yeast lysosome
      (vacuole) for degradation, The glucose-induced targeting of FBPase
      to the vacuole for degradation occurs in cells grown under a variety
      of metabolic conditions. Immunoelectron microscopic studies
      demonstrate that the uptake of FBPase by the vacuole is mediated in
      part by an autophagic process, FBPase can be found on the vacuolar
      membrane and also at the sites of membrane invaginations,
      Furthermore, FBPase is associated with different forms of vesicles,
      which are induced to accumulate inside the vacuole, We have
      identified peroxisomes as the organelles that are delivered to the
      vacuole for degradation when cells are replenished with glucose,
      Ultrastructural studies indicate that peroxisomes are engulfed by
      the vacuole by an autophagic process, leading to the destruction of
      whole organelles in the vacuole. Furthermore, the galactose
      transporter (Gal2p) is also delivered from the plasma membrane to
      the vacuole for degradation in response to glucose. Gal2p is
      delivered to the vacuole through the endocytic pathway, as mutants
      defective in receptor-mediated endocytosis fail to degrade Gal2p in
      response to glucose. [References: 44]

AB  - The ntpJ gene, the tail end in the vacuolar type Na+-ATPase (ntp)
      operon of Enterococcus hirae, encodes a putative 49-kDa hydrophobic
      protein resembling K+ transporter protein in Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae (Takase, K., Kakinuma, S., Yamato, I., Konishi, K.,
      Igarashi, K., and Kakinuma, Y. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269,
      11037-11044). Northern blotting experiment revealed that the ntpJ
      gene was transcribed as a cistron in the ntp operon. We constructed
      an Enterococcus strain in which the ntpJ gene was disrupted by
      cassette mutagenesis with erythromycin resistance gene. The growth
      of this mutant was normal at low pH. However, the mutant did not
      grow at high pH in K+-limited medium (less than 1 mM), while the
      wild type strain grew well; the internal K+ concentration of this
      mutant was as low as 7% of that of the wild type strain, suggesting
      that the K+ accumulation at high pH was inactivated by disruption of
      the ntpJ gene. Potassium uptake activity via the KtrII system, which
      had been proposed as the proton potential-independent,
      Na+-ATPase-coupled system working at high pH (Kakinuma, Y., and
      Harold, F. M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2086-2091), was missing in
      this mutant strain. However this mutant retained as high activities
      of Na+-ATPase and Na+ pumping as the wild type strain. From these
      results, we conclude that the NtpJ is a membraneous component of the
      KtrII K+ uptake system but not a functional subunit of vacuolar
      Na+-ATPase complex; the interplay between the KtrII system and the
      Na+-ATPase was discussed. [References: 43]

AB  - Most models proposed to explain the disease-associated expansion of
      (CTG)(n) .(CAG)(n) and (CGG)(n) .(CCG)(n) trinucleotide repeats
      include the formation of slipped strand DNA structures during
      replication; however, physical evidence for these alternative DNA
      secondary structures has not been reported. Using cloned fragments
      from the myotonic dystrophy (DM) and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA) loci
      containing normal, premutation, and full mutation lengths of
      repeats, we report the formation of novel alternative DNA secondary
      structures that map within the repeat tracts during reannealing of
      complementary strands, containing equal lengths of repeats, into
      linear duplex DNA molecules. Linear duplex DNA molecules containing
      these alternative DNA secondary structures are characterized by
      reduced electrophoretic mobilities in polyacrylamide gels. These
      alternative secondary structures are stable at physiological ionic
      strengths and to temperatures up to at least 55 degrees C. Following
      reduplexing, the CAG strand of the (CTG)(n) .(CAG)(n) repeats is
      preferentially sensitive to mung bean nuclease, suggesting the
      presence of single-stranded DNA in the alternative DNA structure.
      For (CTG)(17), which is a repeat length found in normal individuals,
      less than 3% of the DNA molecules formed alternative DNA structures
      upon reduplexing. DNA molecules containing (CTG)(50) or (CTG)(255),
      which represent premutation and full mutation lengths of triplet
      repeats, respectively, formed a heterogeneous population of
      alternative DNA structures in >50% of DNA molecules. The complexity
      of the structures formed increased with the length of the triplet
      repeat. The relationship between repeat length and the propensity of
      formation and complexity of the novel structures correlates with the
      effect of repeat length on genetic instability in human diseases.
      These are the first results consistent with the existence of slipped
      strand DNA structures. The potential involvement of these
      structures, which we term S-DNA, in the genetic instability of
      triplet repeats is discussed. [References: 81]

AB  - The LAG3 protein has several features in common with CD4, suggesting

      mice with a Lag3 null mutation have now been shown to exhibit a
      defect in the natural killer cell, rather than the T cell,
      compartment. Killing of certain tumor targets by natural killer
      cells from these mice was inhibited or even abolished, whereas lysis
      of cells displaying major histocompatibility complex class I
      disparities remained intact. It appears that LAG3 is a receptor or
      coreceptor that defines different modes of natural killing.

AB  - Petunia embryos carrying the no epical meristem (nam) mutation fail
      to develop a shoot apical meristem. Occasional shoots on nam(-)
      seedlings bear flowers that develop ten instead of five primordia in
      the second whorl. Double mutants with the homeotic gene green petals
      show that nam acts independently of organ identity in whorl 2 and
      now also affects primordium number in whorl 3. The nam gene was
      isolated by transposon tagging. The encoded protein shares a
      conserved N-terminal domain with several other proteins of unknown
      function and thus represents a novel class of proteins. Strikingly,
      nam mRNA accumulates in cells at the boundaries of meristems and
      primordia. These data indicate a role for nam in determining
      positions of meristems and primordia. [References: 40]

SO  - Cell 1996 Apr 19;85(2):171-182
MH  - Genes.  Sequences.  Thaliana
AB  - The cpd mutation localized by T-DNA tagging on Arabidopsis
      chromosome 5-14.3 inhibits cell elongation controlled by the
      ecdysone-like brassinosteroid hormone brassinolide. The cpd mutant
      displays de-etiolation and derepression of light-induced genes in
      the dark, as well as dwarfism, male sterility, and activation of
      stress-regulated genes in the light. The CPD gene encodes a
      cytochrome P450 (CYP90) sharing homologous domains with steroid
      hydroxylases. The phenotype of the cpd mutant is restored to wild
      type both by feeding with C23-hydroxylated brassinolide precursors
      and by ectopic overexpression of the CPD cDNA. Brassinosteroids also
      compensate for different cell elongation defects of Arabidopsis dot,
      cop, fus, and axr2 mutants, indicating that these steroids play an
      essential role in the regulation of plant development. [References:

      We have characterized Arabidopsis ''hookless'' mutants that are
      defective in differential growth in the hypocotyl. HOOKLESS1 was
      cloned and its predicted protein shows similarity to a diverse group
      of N-acetyltransferases. HOOKLESS1 mRNA is increased by treatment
      with ethylene and decreased in the ethylene-insensitive mutant ein2.
      High level expression of HOOKLESS1 mRNA results in constitutive hook
      curvature. The morphology of the hookless hypocotyl is phenocopied
      by inhibitors of auxin transport or by high levels of endogenous or
      exogenous auxin. Spatial patterns of expression of two immediate
      early auxin-responsive genes are altered in hookless1 mutants,
      suggesting that the ethylene response gene HOOKLESS1 controls
      differential cell growth by regulating auxin activity. [References:

AB  - In C. elegans, the anchor cell signal induces Pn.p cells to form the
      vulva by activating a conserved receptor tyrosine kinase pathway.
      lin-2 and lin-7 mutants exhibit a vulvaless phenotype similar to the
      phenotype observed when this signaling pathway is defective. We have
      found that LIN-7 is a cell junction-associated protein that binds to
      the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase. LET-23 is also localized to the
      cell junctions, and both LIN-2 and LIN-7 are required for this
      localization. LET-23 overexpression rescues the lin-2 or lin-7
      vulvaless phenotype, suggesting that increased receptor density can
      compensate for mislocalization. These results suggest that proper
      localization of LET-23 receptor to the Pn.p cell junctions is
      required for signaling activity. [References: 46]

AB  - Operation of the secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells requires the

      appropriate target organelle. This is mediated in part by integral
      membrane proteins termed v-SNAREs (on vesicles) and t-SNAREs (on the
      target membranes). We describe a novel yeast t-SNARE that resides on
      the endoplasmic reticulum and mediates retrograde traffic from the
      Golgi complex. Mutation of this protein prevents both the HDEL
      receptor and a membrane protein bearing a dibasic retrieval signal
      from recycling to the endoplasmic reticulum. Forward traffic is also
      blocked, but only indirectly. Comparison with other yeast mutants
      indicates that Sec21p (gamma-COP) and Sec20p (an endoplasmic
      reticulum membrane protein) are also involved primarily, if not
      exclusively, in retrograde transport. [References: 52]

AB  - Tight docking of the ribosome at the translocation channel ensures
      that nascent secretory proteins are shielded from the cytoplasm
      during transfer into the endoplasmic reticulum. Discrete pause
      transfer sequences mediate the transient stopping of translocation
      in certain proteins. Here we show that during a translocational
      pause, the junction between the ribosome and translocation channel
      is opened, exposing the nascent chain to the cytosol. While
      transient, this opening is sufficient to demonstrate macromolecular
      interactions between the translocating chain and molecules added to
      the cytosol, such as antibodies and site-specific proteases.
      Moreover, this opening is accompanied by alterations in the proteins
      that neighbor the nascent chain. These results demonstrate that
      specific sequences within a translocating nascent chain can elicit
      dramatic and reversible structural changes in the translocation
      machinery. Thus, the translocon is dynamic and can be regulated.

AB  - Despite an increased understanding of the cellular and molecular
      biology of the CFTR Cl- channel, it is not known how defective Cl-
      transport across airway epithelia causes chronic bacterial
      infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways. Here, we show that
      common CF pathogens were killed when added to the apical surface of
      normal airway epithelia. In contrast, these bacteria multiplied on
      CF epithelia. We found that bactericidal activity was present in
      airway surface fluid of both normal and CF epithelia. However,
      because bacterial killing required a low NaCl concentration and
      because CF surface fluid has a high NaCl concentration, CF epithelia
      failed to kill bacteria. This defect was corrected by reducing the
      NaCl concentration on CF epithelia. These data explain how the loss
      of CFTR Cl- channels may lead to lung disease and suggest new
      approaches to therapy. [References: 42]

AB  - The KH module is a sequence motif found in a number of proteins that
      are known to be in close association with RNA. Experimental evidence
      suggests a direct involvement of KH in RNA binding. The human FMR1
      protein, which has two KH domains, is associated with fragile X
      syndrome, the most common inherited cause of mental retardation.
      Here we present the three-dimensional solution structure of the KH
      module. The domain consists of a stable beta alpha alpha beta beta
      alpha fold. On the basis of our results, we suggest a potential
      surface for RNA binding centered on the loop between the first two
      helices. Substitution of a well-conserved hydrophobic residue
      located on the second helix destroys the KH fold; a mutation of this
      position in FMR1 leads to an aggravated fragile X phenotype.

AB  - VP39 is a bifunctional vaccinia virus protein that acts as both an
      mRNA cap-specific RNA 2'-O-methyltransferase and a poly(A)
      polymerase processivity factor. Here, we report the 1.85 Angstrom
      crystal structure of a VP39 variant complexed with its AdoMet
      cofactor. VP39 comprises a single core domain with structural
      similarity to the catalytic domains of other methyltransferases.
      Surface features and mutagenesis data suggest two possible
      RNA-binding sites with novel underlying architecture, one of which
      forms a cleft spanning the region adjacent to the methyltransferase
      active site. This report provides a prototypic structure for an RNA
      methyltransferase, a protein that interacts with the mRNA 5' cap,
      and an intact poxvirus protein. [References: 54]

AB  - Mu transposition occurs exclusively using a pair of recombination
      sites found at the ends of the phage genome. To address the
      mechanistic basis of this specificity, we have determined both where
      the individual subunits of the tetrameric transposase bind on the
      DNA and where they catalyze DNA joining. We demonstrate that
      subunits do not catalyze recombination at the site adjacent to where
      they are bound, but rather on the opposite end of the phage genome.
      Furthermore, subunits bound to two different sites contribute to
      catalysis of one reaction step. This interwoven subunit arrangement
      suggests a molecular explanation for the precision with which
      recombination occurs using a pair of DNA signals and provides an
      example of the way in which the architecture of a protein-DNA
      complex can define the reaction products. [References: 66]

AB  - Central to the Mu transpositional recombination are the two chemical
      steps; donor DNA cleavage and strand transfer. These reactions occur
      within the Mu transpososome that contains two Mu DNA end segments
      bound to a tetramer of MuA, the transposase. To investigate which
      MuA-monomer catalyzes which chemical reaction, we made
      transpososomes containing wild-type and active site mutant MuA. By
      preloading the MuA variants onto Mu end DNA fragments of different
      length prior to transpososome assembly, we could track the catalysis
      by MuA bound to each Mu end segment. The donor DNA end that
      underwent the chemical reaction was identified. Both the donor DNA
      cleavage and strand transfer were catalyzed in trans by the MuA
      monomers bound to the partner Mu end. This arrangement explains why
      the transpososome assembly is a prerequisite for the chemical steps.

SO  - Cell 1996 Apr 19;85(2):281-290
MH  - Neuropeptide-y.  Food-intake.  Weight.  Mice
AB  - The mutated gene responsible for the tubby obesity phenotype has
      been identified by positional cloning. A single base change within a
      splice donor site results in the incorrect retention of a single
      intron in the mature tub mRNA transcript. The consequence of this
      mutation is the substitution of the carboxy-terminal 44 amino acids
      with 24 intron-encoded amino acids. The normal transcript appears to
      be abundantly expressed in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain
      involved in body weight regulation. Variation in the relative
      abundance of alternative splice products is observed between inbred
      mouse strains and appears to correlate with an intron length
      polymorphism. This allele of tub is a candidate for a previously
      reported diet-induced obesity quantitative trait locus on mouse
      chromosome 7. [References: 44]

AB  - Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is being used for hematopoietic rescue
      after myeloablative therapy in a rapidly growing number of patients,
      Recent developments of cord blood banking, ex vivo progenitor
      expansion and gene therapy techniques have raised the issue of
      efficient progenitor and stem cell enrichment procedures using UCB,
      We have used discontinuous density gradient techniques to analyze
      progenitor distribution in the mononuclear cell fraction of cord
      blood, This resulted in establishment of a highly reproducible,
      rapid, cost-effective single-step density separation method that
      generates a light density fraction, which when compared to
      conventional mononuclear cells has a high number of clonogenic
      progenitors, can be extensively expanded in vitro for up to 21 days
      and has the ability to sustain long-term hematopoiesis when
      inoculated on a preformed stromal layer, It can also serve as an
      efficient target for retrovirally mediated gene transfer, utilizing
      a vector expressing a mutated dihydrofolate reductase gene that
      confers methotrexate resistance. [References: 29]

AB  - Rapid advances in cancer gene therapy are driven by an explosive
      development of gene transfer technology and a strong demand for
      seeking alternatives to unsatisfactory conventional cancer
      therapies. Discovery of the genetic basis of cancer has indicated
      that cancer is a disease of genes. Among a variety of approaches to
      gene therapy of cancer, antisense oncogene and tumor suppressor gene
      therapy of cancer are the two strategies that aim at correcting
      genetic disorders of cancer through suppression of the abnormal
      expression of the proliferative genes. The potential effectiveness
      of these approaches is promised by their precise targeting at the
      mechanisms of the disease. Examples of several preclinical studies
      of these types of approaches that led to the approval of clinical
      trials are reviewed. Limitation and future development of these
      approaches are also discussed. [References: 137]

AB  - The liver is an important and attractive target for the development
      of gene therapy strategies. Many genetic diseases are manifested in
      the liver, and both infectious and malignant diseases affect this
      organ. Retroviral and adenoviral vectors have been shown to infect
      hepatocytes with varying efficiently in vitro and in vivo. The
      presence of unique receptors at the cellular membrane of hepatocytes
      has stimulated the development of transfer strategies based on
      receptor targeting of vectors. The results of a first clinical trial
      for gene therapy in the liver based on ex vivo gene delivery has
      shown both the feasibility and the limits of current technology.
      This review discusses both existing vectors and strategies and
      prospective developments towards liver-directed gene therapy of
      genetic and malignant diseases. [References: 89]

AB  - Due to the dependency on aromatic precursors, the growth of
      Salmonella typhimurium aroA(-) is limited in immunocompetent mice.
      Here we show that H-21-A beta(-/-) mice (lacking MHC class II
      molecules and thus devoid of mature CD4(+) TCR-alpha beta cells),
      TCR-beta(-/-) mice (devoid of TCR-alpha beta cells), and IFN-gamma
      R(-/-) mice (unresponsive to IFN-gamma) are highly susceptible to S.
      typhimurium aroA(-) infection compared with heterozygous controls,
      In contrast, beta(2)m-deficient mice (lacking surface MHC class I
      and thus devoid of conventional CD8(+) T cells) or TCR-delta(-/-)
      mice (devoid of TCR-gamma delta cells) were equally as resistant to
      S. typhimurium aroA(-) infection as their heterozygous littermates.
      These findings emphasize the vital role of CD4(+) TCR-alpha beta
      cells and IFN-gamma in resistance against S. typhimurium aroA(-).
      Sublethal inocula of S. fyphimurium aroA(-) led to permanent
      infection in H-21-alpha beta(-/-) mice, suggesting that bacterial
      starvation is insufficient for sterile clearance in immunocompetent
      mice and that MHC class II-dependent immune mechanisms are required
      for pathogen eradication. The TCR-beta(-/-) mice suffered from
      salmonellosis more severely than the MHC class II-deficient mutants,
      suggesting an auxiliary function of CD8(+) T cells, Recombinant S.
      typhimurium aroA(-), secreting listeriolysin (Hly) of Listeria
      monocytogenes, are capable of escaping from the phagosome into the
      cytosol of the host cell. However, the course of infection of these
      recombinant S. typhimurium SL7207 Hlys and control strains did not
      differ in beta(2)m(-/-) mutants. This finding argues against direct
      correlation of cytosolic location of S. typhimurium SL7207 Hlys with
      CD8(+) T cell dependency of protection. [References: 37]

      NOT PREVENT DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMICALLY INDUCED SKIN PAPILLOMAS AND
      CARCINOMAS

AB  - Expression of the B7-1 (CD80) costimulatory molecule in a variety of
      tumor cell lines leads to an enhanced CD8(+) T cell response to
      tumor Ags. We used transgenic mice constitutively expressing B7-1 on
      keratinocytes (K14/87-1 line) to determine whether keratinocyte B7-1
      expression would inhibit the development of papillomas and
      carcinomas following two-stage chemical carcinogenesis in skin, FVB
      inbred mice carrying the K14/B7-1 transgene and controls were
      initiated with 25 mu g of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and
      promoted weekly with 5 mu g of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
      for 20 wk, Expression of the B7-1 transgene did not result in
      statistically significant decreases in the mean number of papillomas
      or carcinomas compared with controls, The incidence of carcinomas in
      both transgenic and control mice reached 90% or greater by 60 wk
      after initiation, Carcinoma cell lines established from the K14/87-1
      mice maintained expression of B7-1 and K-q, These B7-1 expressing
      carcinomas grew progressively following intradermal injection into
      syngeneic FVB mice, further demonstrating their inability to evoke
      protective tumor immunity, These same carcinoma cell lines were
      rapidly rejected by minor alloantigen-mismatched SWR mice,
      confirming their susceptibility to immune effector mechanisms. The
      failure of constitutive B7-1 expression on keratinocytes to prevent
      the growth of squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas may reflect
      the limited immunogenicity of tumors arising after
      initiation-promotion carcinogenesis. Our results in this transgenic
      model system are further evidence that B7-1 gene therapy alone may
      not be sufficient to induce protective immunity to some types of
      tumors. [References: 43]

AB  - Gene therapy offers a novel approach to treating human joint
      diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In the present study, we have
      used the retrovirus, MFG-IRAP, to transfer the human IL-1 receptor
      antagonist protein (IRAP) gene to rabbits' knees and have assessed
      its impact on inflammatory and chondrodestructive aspects of the
      acute phase of antigen-induced arthritis in these joints,
      Surprisingly, intra-articular expression of IRAP was three- to
      fivefold higher in arthritic knees than in nonarthritic knees,
      accumulating to levels of over 20 ng/knee in the highest expressing
      joints. This level of expression produced a marked chondroprotective
      effect but a milder anti-inflammatory one. Both the increased
      cartilage matrix catabolism and the inhibition of matrix synthesis
      that occur in antigen-induced arthritis were abrogated in the
      presence of the IRAP gene; the latter effect was particularly
      strong. Of the indices of inflammation that were examined, only
      leukocyte influx into the joint space was inhibited, and this effect
      declined with time. Concentrations of rabbit IL-1 were reduced by
      the IRAP gene, suggesting inhibition of an autocrine induction loop.
      These data demonstrate that the course of arthritic disease in the
      rabbit knee can be altered by genetic manipulation, thus encouraging
      the further development of gene treatments for human joint diseases.

MH  - Secondary structure
AB  - The 65-nucleotide leader on the cloned bovine coronavirus defective
      interfering (DI) RNA, when marked by mutations, has been shown to
      rapidly convert to the wild-type leader of the helper virus
      following DI RNA transfection into helper virus-infected cells. A
      model of leader-primed transcription in which free leader supplied
      in trans by the helper virus interacts by way of its flanking
      5'UCUAAAC3' sequence element with the 3'-proximal 3'AGAUUUG5'
      promoter on the DI RNA minus strand to prime RNA replication has
      been used to explain this phenomenon. To test this model, the
      UCUAAAC element which occurs only once in the BCV 5' untranslated
      region was either deleted or completely substituted in input DI RNA
      template, and evidence of leader conversion was sought. In both
      cases, leader conversion occurred rapidly, indicating that this
      element is not required on input RNA for the conversion event.
      Substitution mutations mapped the crossover region to a
      24-nucleotide segment that begins within the UCUAAAC sequence and
      extends downstream. Although structure probing of the bovine
      coronavirus 5' untranslated region indicated that the UCUAAAC
      element is in the loop of a prominent stem and thus theoretically
      available for base pair-directed priming, no evidence of an
      unattached leader early in infection that might have served as a
      primer for transcription was found by RNase protection studies.
      These results together suggest that leader conversion on the DI RNA
      5' terminus is not guided by the UCUAAAC element and might arise
      instead from a high-frequency, region-specific, homologous
      recombination event perhaps during minus-strand synthesis rather
      than by leader priming during plus-strand synthesis. [References:

AB  - The ability of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) to transduce
      cells with a marker gene in vitro was found to be substantially
      increased by the presence of adenovirus. Transfection experiments
      with adenovirus genomic DNA suggest that this increase is not
      facilitated by adenovirus-mediated viral uptake but is instead
      dependent on adenovirus gene expression. Using various adenovirus
      mutants, we were able to map this function to early-region E4 open
      reading frame 6. Plasmid expression of open reading frame 6 protein
      in cells infected with recombinant AAV increased transduction
      between 100- and 1,000-fold. The increase in transduction was not
      dependent on the recombinant AAV gene cassette but instead appeared
      to involve an immediate early step of the AAV life cycle. Chemical
      and physical agents that have been shown to induce helper-free
      replication of wild-type AAV were also able to stimulate recombinant
      AAV transduction, suggesting that the phenomenon might affect AAV
      DNA replication. Further experiments showed that viral uncoating was
      not affected and that the rate-limiting step involved synthesis of a
      second strand on the single-stranded genomic AAV DNA. These data
      suggest that the adenovirus E4 region, as well as chemical and
      physical agents, can play an essential role in an immediate-early
      step of the AAV life cycle, specifically in second-strand synthesis,
      and have important implications for the use of AAV vectors in gene
      therapy protocols. [References: 47]

AB  - Gene therapy vectors based on human DNA viruses could be mobilized
      or rescued from individuals who are subsequently infected with the
      corresponding wild-type (wt) helper viruses. This phenomenon has
      been effectively modeled in vitro with both adenovirus (Ad) and
      adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors but has not previously been
      studied in vivo. In the current study, we have developed an in vivo
      model to study the interactions of a recombinant AAV vector
      (AAV-CFTR) with wt AAV type 2 (AAV2) and a host range mutant Ad
      (Ad2HR405) for which monkey cells are permissive (D. E. Brough, S.
      A. Rice, S. Sell, and D. F. Klessig, J. Virol. 55:206-212, 1985),
      AAV-CFTR was administered to the respiratory epithelium of the nose
      or lung of rhesus macaques. Primary cells were harvested from the
      infusion site at time points up to 3 months after vector
      administration to confirm vector DNA persistence. Vector DNA was
      present in episomal form and could be rescued in vitro only by
      addition of wt AAV2 and Ad. In in vivo rescue studies, vector was
      administered before or after wt-AAV2 and Ad2HR405 infection, and the
      shedding of AAV-CFTR was examined. Ad2HR405 and wt-AAV2 infections
      were established in the nose with concomitant administration.
      wt-AAV2 replication occurred in the lung when virus was administered
      directly at a high titer to the lower respiratory tract. AAV-CFTR
      vector rescue was also observed in the latter setting. Although
      these studies were performed with small numbers of animals within
      each group, it appears that AAV-CFTR DNA persists in the primate
      respiratory tract and that this model may be useful for studies of
      recombinant AAV vector rescue. [References: 26]

AB  - Background: Protein tyrosine kinases play an important role in
      cellular metabolism as key components of signal transduction
      pathways. They are involved in cellular growth, differentiation, and
      development. Receptor tyrosine kinases (EGF receptor and c-erbB2)
      have been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of cancer. In
      ovarian cancer, overexpression of c-erbB2, a type I receptor, has
      been correlated with an adverse effect on survival of patients.

      Material and Methods: An unusual receptor tyrosine kinase, H-RYK,
      has been isolated from a complimentary DNA library of SKOV-3, an
      epithelial ovarian cancer cell line, using a polymerase chain
      reaction-mediated approach.

      Results: The primary structure of the predicted amino acid sequence
      of the protein shows a novel NH2-terminal region. The catalytic
      region shows homology to other tyrosine kinases, the closest
      homology being with v-sea (39%). A significant alteration in the
      catalytic domain is that the highly conserved ''DFG'' tripler in
      subdomain VII is altered to ''DNA.'' The gene was mapped to
      chromosome 3q22. A single transcript of 3.0 kb is expressed in
      heart, brain, lung, placenta, liver, muscle, kidney, and pancreas by
      Northern analysis with maximal expression in skeletal muscle. In
      situ hybridization analysis on human tissues demonstrated
      localization of message in the epithelial and stromal compartment of
      tissues such as brain, lung, colon, kidney, and breast. There was
      minimal to absent expression of H-RYK on surface epithelium of
      ovaries. Ln benign (3) and borderline tumors of the ovary (5), there
      was expression in the stromal compartment. However, in malignant
      tumors (24) there was increased expression predominantly confined to
      the epithelium. Polyclonal antisera raised against synthetic
      peptides recognize a 100-kD protein in ovarian cancer cells and
      other cell lines. In contrast to other receptor tyrosine kinases,
      the receptor did not phosphorylate in an in vitro kinase assay.

      Conclusions: The expression of this unusual receptor tyrosine kinase
      in epithelial ovarian cancer suggests that it may be involved in
      tumor progression, which needs further investigation. [References:

AB  - No targeting sequence for peroxisomal integral membrane proteins has
      yet been identified, We have previously shown that a region of 67
      amino acids is necessary to target Pmp47, a protein that spans the
      membrane six times, to peroxisomes, This region comprises two
      membrane spans and the intervening loop, We now demonstrate that the
      20 amino acid loop, which is predicted to face the matrix, is both
      necessary and sufficient for peroxisomal targeting, Sufficiency was
      demonstrated with both chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and green
      fluorescent protein as carriers. There is a cluster of basic amino
      acids in the middle of the loop that we predict protrudes from the
      membrane surface into the matrix by a flanking stem structure. We
      show that the targeting signal is composed of this basic cluster and
      a block of amino acids immediately downstream from it. [References:

MH  - Localization.  Receptors.  Motility.  Surface.  Cells
AB  - Dicryostelium cells that lack the myoB isoform were previously shown
      to exhibit reduced efficiencies of phagocytosis and chemotactic
      aggregation (''streaming'') and to crawl at about half the speed of
      wild-type cells. Of the four other Dictyostelium myosin I isoforms
      identified to date, myoC and myoD are the most similar to myoB in
      terms of tail domain sequence. Furthermore, we show here that myoC,
      like myoB and myoD, is concentrated in actin-rich cortical regions
      like the leading edge of migrating cells. To look for evidence of
      functional overlap between these isoforms, we analyzed myoB, myoC,
      and myoD single mutants, myoB/myoD double mutants, and
      myoB/myoC/myoD triple mutants, which were created using a
      combination of gene targeting techniques and constitutive expression
      of antisense RNA. With regard to the speed of locomoting,
      aggregation-stage cells, of the three single mutants, only the myoB
      mutant was significantly slower. Moreover, double and triple mutants
      were only slightly slower than the myoB single mutant. Consistent
      with this, the protein level of myoB alone rises dramatically during
      early development, suggesting that a special demand is placed on
      this one isoform when cells become highly motile. We also found,
      however, that the absolute amount of myoB protein in
      aggregation-stage cells is much higher than that for myoC and myoD,
      suggesting that what appears to be a case of nonoverlapping function
      could be the result of large differences in the amounts of
      functionally overlapping isoforms. Streaming assays also suggest
      that myoC plays a significant role in some aspect of motility other
      than cell speed. With regard to phagocytosis, both myoB and myoC
      single mutants exhibited significant reductions in initial rate,
      suggesting that these two isoforms perform nonredundant roles in
      supporting the phagocytic process. In triple mutants these defects
      were not additive, however. Finally, because double and triple
      mutants exhibited significant and progressive decreases in doubling
      times, we also measured the kinetics of fluid phase endocytic flux
      (uptake, transit time, efflux). Not only do all three isoforms
      contribute to this process, but their contributions are synergistic.
      While these results, when taken together, refute the simple notion
      that these three ''classic'' myosin I isoforms perform exclusively
      identical functions, they do reveal that all three share in
      supporting at least one cellular process (endocytosis), and they
      identify several other processes (motility, streaming, and
      phagocytosis) that are supported to a significant extent by either
      individual isoforms or various combinations of them. [References:

AB  - THE PRIMARY PATHOGEN INVOLVED in certain forms of early-onset
      periodontitis is A. actinomycetemcomitans. Among its numerous
      potential virulence factors is a leukotoxin that kills certain host
      defense cells. In order to analyze the regulation and in vivo
      function of leukotoxin and other virulence factors in A.
      actinomycetemcomitans, molecular genetic approaches are being
      established. Although there has been significant progress in
      developing plasmids and bacteriophage as E. coil/A.
      actinomycetemcomitans shuttle vectors, more work needs to be done.
      Tn5-based transposon mutagenesis has been shown to work in this
      organism. Targeted mutagenesis is now possible in A.
      actinomycetemcomitans; exogenously introduced DNA recombines
      efficiently with the homologous chromosomal locus. These techniques
      have been applied to studies of leukotoxin. Targeted mutagenesis has
      been used to construct leukotoxin negative mutants that are
      otherwise isogenic with their leukotoxin-producing parent strain.
      These mutants can be tested in animal models to ascertain the in
      vivo role of leukotoxin in A. actinomycetemcomitans pathogenesis.
      Gene targeting has also been used to make strains in which the
      leukotoxin promoter is regulating the synthesis of a
      beta-galactosidase reporter gene. Such strains have been used to
      show that leukotoxin synthesis increases in cells grown
      anaerobically, but that several other environmental changes had
      little effect on leukotoxin synthesis; Finally, plasmid shuttle
      vectors with leukotoxin promoters from various strains of A.
      actinomycetemcomitans fused to reporter genes have been used in
      cis/trans tests to show that leukotoxin promoter sequences and
      strain-specific trans-acting factors are important in determining
      why different strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans produce different
      levels of leukotoxin. [References: 50]

AB  - The incidence of Leydig cell adenomas increases in CD rats fed for 2
      years with the hepatic peroxisome proliferator, ammonium
      perfluorooctanoate (C8). Treatment with C8 increased the serum
      concentration of estradiol in 2-week gavage studies, and feeding
      studies at various time points up to 2 years, and was also
      accompanied by increases in liver weight and hepatic beta-oxidation
      activity, Since peroxisome proliferators induce both hepatic
      beta-oxidation and specific cytochrome P450 enzymes, C8 may also
      induce aromatase (cytochrome P450-19A1), the cytochrome P450
      monooxygenase which converts androgens to estrogens. This hypothesis
      was investigated in the present study. Adult male CD rats were dosed
      daily by gavage for 14 days with 0, 0.2, 2, 20, or 40 mg C8/kg body
      wt. An additional group, the pair-fed control, was fed at a rate
      matched to the daily consumption by the 40 mg C8/kg group. Treatment
      with C8 produced a dose-dependent decrease in body weight, and
      increases in absolute and relative liver weights, and in the protein
      yield of hepatic microsomes. These C8-induced changes were
      associated with a 2-fold increase in the serum concentration of
      estradiol and up to a 16-fold increase in total hepatic aromatase
      activity. A significant linear correlation was established between
      serum estradiol and total hepatic aromatase activity. The absolute
      weights and the aromatase activity of the testes were not affected
      by C8. Hepatic peroxisomal beta-oxidation activity and the
      microsomal concentration of total cytochrome P450 were also
      increased by C8, A comparison of estimated EC50 values suggested
      that these parameters may be less sensitive to induction by C8 than
      hepatic aromatase activity. Co-incubation of control liver
      microsomes with C8 in the aromatase assay for 2 hr dose dependently
      reduced the apparent aromatase activity. This inhibition of
      aromatase in vitro but increase in vivo was further investigated
      using cultured rat hepatocytes. Decreases in aromatase activity were
      found after up to 42 hr of treatment with C8, but the enzyme
      activity was increased almost 2-fold after 66 hr. The results of
      this study suggest that the increased serum concentration of
      estradiol produced by C8 in rats is at least partly due to a direct
      effect on the liver to increase synthesis of estradiol through
      induction of aromatase cytochrome P450 in the endoplasmic reticulum.

AB  - The effects of zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, on hepatic
      peroxisomal enzyme activity as well as hepatic drug metabolizing
      activity in male and female CD-1 mice were assessed after oral
      administration of the drug (50, 150, or 450 mg/kg/day) for 14 days,
      The effects were compared to those in mice receiving clofibrate
      (CLOF; 462 mg/kg/day, po) or sodium phenobarbital(PB; 50 mg/kg/day,
      po). Zileuton pretreatment caused hepatomegaly and elevated liver
      peroxisomal KCN-insensitive palmitoyl CoA oxidase activity in a
      dose-dependent manner, However, these changes were marginal (less
      than or equal to 121% increase), when compared to those elicited by
      CLOF (similar to 370% increase). In both sexes, zileuton
      pretreatment also caused a dose-dependent increase in the levels of
      liver microsomal cytochrome P450 2B and cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4A)
      proteins, and their associated monooxygenase activity. In the case
      of CYP4A, the induction of lauric acid 12-hydroxylase activity by
      zileuton was more pronounced in female (maximal 851% increase) than
      in male mice (maximal 111% increase). Based on the dose normalized
      response observed in CD-1 mice, zileuton can be considered a
      relatively weak inducer of peroxisome enzyme activities (cf. CLOF)
      and a moderate inducer of cytochromes P450, Moreover, zileuton
      exhibits characteristics of both a PB- and a CLOF-type hepatic
      enzyme inducer, especially in the female mice. (C) 1996 Academic

AB  - WY-14,643, a lipid-lowering drug, increases basal rates of oxygen
      uptake in perfused livers. Because peroxisomes consume oxygen for
      H2O2 production and are induced by WY-14,643 treatment, it is
      possible that peroxisomal beta-oxidation can account for some of
      this increase in cellular respiration. Therefore, cyanide, an
      inhibitor of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, was infused into
      livers of WY-14,643-fed rats (0.1% WY-14,643 in laboratory rat chow
      for 1, 21, and 105 days) to assess peroxisomal cyanide-insensitive
      respiration. As expected, the addition of cyanide abolished oxygen
      uptake nearly completely; however, after approximately 20 min oxygen
      consumption unexpectedly returned to basal levels in 105-day
      WY-14,643-treated animals but not in untreated controls. Urea
      synthesis, a process dependent upon ATP, was decreased and remained
      low during cyanide infusion in livers from both groups, indicating
      that mitochondria were not responsible for this unusual increase in
      oxygen uptake in the presence of cyanide. Methanol metabolism, which
      requires oxygen to form H2O2, was decreased from 37 +/- 5 to 6 +/- 1
      mu mol/g/hr in all groups treated with cyanide; however, it was
      increased significantly about 20 min later to 25 mu mol/g/hr in
      livers from WY-14,643-treated rats, indicating that oxygen for
      peroxisomal H2O2 production is involved in cellular respiration in
      the presence of cyanide. Fasting abolished the recovery of both
      oxygen uptake and methanol metabolism in WY-14,643-fed rats,
      suggesting that ATP for acyl CoA synthetase, an enzyme which
      metabolizes fatty acids to acyl CoA compounds, is provided by
      glycolysis. Indeed, oleate significantly increased methanol
      metabolism in fed control rats from 8 +/- 4 to 26 +/- 3 mu mol/g/hr
      in the presence of cyanide, indicating that fatty acid supply is
      necessary for peroxisomal respiration. Taken together, these
      experiments demonstrate that when mitochondrial respiration is
      inhibited, livers from rats fed WY-14,643 chronically have the
      unique ability of metabolizing fatty acids through the peroxisome
      using glycolytic ATP. (C) 1996 academic Press, Inc. [References: 32]

AB  - Five to ten percent of breast cancer is attributable to the
      autosomal dominant inheritance of a high-risk susceptibility gene.
      There are a number of known inherited cancer syndromes that confer a
      higher risk of breast cancer. Recently, the BRCA1 gene, which is
      responsible for 45% of hereditary early-onset breast cancer and for
      the majority of co-inheritance of breast and ovarian cancer, has
      been cloned. Another gene that confers an increased risk of breast
      cancer is the BRCA2 gene, which maps to the long arm of chromosome
      13 by linkage analysis. Mutations in BRCA2 account for approximately
      40% of hereditary early-onset breast cancer. In addition, at least
      7% of breast cancer may occur in women who are heterozygous for
      mutations in a gene for ataxia-telangiectasia, an autosomal
      recessive chromosome instability syndrome. Predictive testing for
      some predisposing conditions is possible through indirect or direct
      mutation testing. In this article, the genetics of breast cancer are
      reviewed, and practical concerns for the surgeon in counseling
      high-risk patients are addressed. [References: 100]

AB  - To examine the role of tenascin (TN) in vivo, we have produced mice
      in which the TN gene is inactivated. In behavioral studies,
      TN-knockout mice showed abnormal behavior such as hyperlocomotion
      and poor swimming ability. Biochemical analysis revealed that
      serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) transmission was decreased in the
      cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, or the striatum of TN-knockout
      mouse brain. The intraperitoneal administration of the DA receptor
      agonist, LY171555 (0.5 mg/kg, BW), inhibited the hyperlocomotion,
      and swimming behavior was transiently improved by the treatment with
      the 5-HT receptor agonist,
      1-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride. These
      findings suggest that TN may play an important role in
      neurotransmissions related to behavior. (C) 1996 Academic Press,

AB  - Five commonly used cationic liposome formulations were tested for
      their ability to deliver DNA to established subcutaneous human tumor
      xenografts in SCID mice. Liposomes were complexed with a mammalian
      expression plasmid containing the bacterial beta-galactosidase gene
      and delivered to tumors by direct injection. The optimal lipid to
      DNA ratios in vivo were markedly different than those observed in
      vitro for each liposome formulation. Tumor size at the time of
      inoculation also effected transfection efficiency significantly. Of
      the five liposome formulations tested, DC-Cholesterol was found to
      be superior to all others in vivo. Even under optimal conditions
      however, the efficiency of in vivo transfection was low in our
      system (similar to 0.3%). Implications of these results for in vivo
      gene therapy of tumors are discussed. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Safe, long-term gene expression is a primary criteria for effective
      gene therapy in the brain, so studies were initiated to evaluate
      adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector transfer of a reporter gene into
      specific sites of the rat brain. In the 4 day old rat, site
      infusions of AAV-CMV-lacZ (1 mu l; 5 X 10(4) particles) produced
      neuronal beta-galactosidase gene expression 3 weeks later in the
      hippocampus and inferior colliculus, but not in the cerebral cortex.
      Seven days after infusion of AAV-CMV-lacZ viral vectors (1 mu l) in
      the adult rat, beta-galactosidase gene expression was found in the
      olfactory tubercle, caudate, hippocampus, piriform cortex and
      inferior colliculus, primarily in multipolar neurons close to the
      infusion site. Three months after vector microinfusion, similar
      levels of gene expression remained in the olfactory tubercle and the
      inferior colliculus, with some reduction found in the caudate, but
      substantial reductions in beta-galactosidase gene expression
      occurred in the hippocampus and piriform cortex. In no case were
      obvious signs of toxicity noted. Therefore, AAV vectors can transfer
      foreign genes into the adult and neonatal CNS, but the pattern and
      longevity of gene expression depends upon the area of brain being
      studied. [References: 19]

AB  - High rates of light-dependent fatty acid synthesis from acetate were
      measured in isolated chloroplasts that were permeabilized to varying
      extents by resuspension in hypotonic reaction medium. The reactions
      in hypotonic medium unsupplemented with cofactors were linear with
      time and were directly proportional to chlorophyll concentration,
      suggesting that the enzymes and cofactors of fatty acid synthesis
      remained tightly integrated and thylakoid associated within
      disrupted chloroplasts. Permeabilized chloroplasts expanded to at
      least twice the volume of intact chloroplasts, lost about 50% of
      their stromal proteins in the medium, and metabolized exogenous
      nucleotides. However, neither acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) nor
      malonyl-CoA inhibited fatty acid synthesis from acetate; nor were
      [1-C-14]acetyl-CoA and [C-14]malonyl-CoA significantly incorporated
      into fatty acids. Fatty acid synthesis from acetate was independent
      of added cofactors but was totally light dependent. Changes in the
      products of fatty acid synthesis were consistent with the loss of
      endogenous glycerol-3-phosphate from permeabilized chloroplasts.
      However, in appropriately supplemented medium, the products of
      acetate incorporation by spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts
      were similar when reactions were carried out in either isotonic or
      hypotonic medium. Taken together, the results of this study suggest
      that the enzymes of fatty acid synthesis with chloroplasts are
      organized into a multienzyme assembly that channels acetate into
      long-chain fatty acids, glycerides, and CoA esters. [References: 43]

SO  - Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London - Series B:
      Biological Sciences 1996 Mar 29;351(1338):365-373
MH  - Nerve growth-factor.  Factor family.  Messenger-rna.  Bdnf.  Ngf.

AB  - The neurotrophins are a family of polypeptide neuronal growth
      factors related to the prototypical neurotrophic factor, nerve
      growth factor (NGF). In mammals this gene family encompasses NGF,
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophins-3 and
      -4/5, (NT-3, NT-4/5). The neurotrophins initiate signal transduction
      in responsive cells by ligand induced dimerization and activation of
      one of the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases; NGF being
      specific for TrkA, BDNF and NT-4/5 for TrkB, and TrkC the preferred
      receptor for NT-3. In accord with differential patterns of
      distribution of Trk receptors in peripheral ganglia, the
      neurotrophins show both distinct and overlapping specificity towards
      subpopulations of sensory neurons of both neural crest and neural
      placode origin. In vitro and in vivo studies, and transgenic mice
      baring targeted null mutations of the neurotrophin genes have
      established that BDNF, NT-3 and NT-4/5, like NGF, play critical
      roles as classical target-derived survival factors for subclasses of
      developing sensory neurons. However, much broader effects of
      neurotrophins on sensory neurons are now evident, including
      paracrine and autocrine actions on neuroblast proliferation,
      phenotypic differentiation, and survival and regeneration in the
      adult. This article provides an overview of the discovery and
      properties of the neurotrophin family, their receptors and their
      actions and specificity for both distinct and overlapping
      subpopulations of spinal and cranial sensory neurons. [References:

AB  - The hypothesis that target-derived neurotrophic factors are
      essential for the survival, differentiation and maintenance of
      sensory, sympathetic and motor neurons has been well supported by
      analysis of mice bearing null mutations in the neurotrophins and
      their receptors. However, the localization of brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a population of dorsal root ganglia
      (DRG) sensory neurons (Ernfors et al. 1990 b; Ernfors & Persson
      1991; Schecterson & Bothwell 1992) suggested the additional
      possibility that BDNF could act in a paracrine or autocrine manner
      to mediate neuronal survival. We tested this hypothesis in cultured
      adult DRG neurons, which survive as single cells in microwells in
      the absence of added trophic factors (Lindsay 1988). About 35 % of
      these neurons were specifically killed by BDNF antisense
      oligonucleotide administration in a dose-dependent manner, with no
      effect of sense oligonucleotides. Antisense administration was
      accompanied by an 80 % decrease in BDNF protein levels over the
      first 24 h of treatment (Acheson et al. 1995). The BDNF autocrine
      loop that we propose to be present in sensory neurons may be
      representative of a broader phenomenon in the nervous system as a
      whole, where the balance of neurotrophic support may shift during
      development from target-derived to paracrine or autocrine modes.
      Perhaps as a consequence of this developmental shift, the survival
      of both peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system
      (CNS) neurons in the adult is less affected by axotomy or target
      removal when compared to their response during development.

AB  - The primary structure of a 38-kDa protein isolated from membrane
      preparations of African trypanosomes was determined by protein and
      DNA sequencing. Searching of the protein database with the
      trypanosome translated amino acid sequence identified glycerol
      3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.8) from various prokaryotic and
      eukaryotic organisms as the optimal scoring protein. Surprisingly,
      the eukaryotic trypanosome enzyme showed the highest degree of
      sequence identity with the corresponding enzyme from the prokaryote
      Escherichia coli. The trypanosome molecule was expressed in
      Escherichia coli and found to be enzymatically active, thus
      confirming the identity of the molecule as an NAD(+)-dependent
      glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. A monoclonal antibody specific
      for the 38-kDa protein was used to localize the enzyme to
      glycosomes. Immunoblotting showed that the monoclonal antibody bound
      to a 38-kDa protein in African trypanosomes but not in T. cruzi,
      Leishmania or Crithidia. The enzyme has a pI of 9.1, a net charge of
      + 17 and contains the peroxisome-like targeting tripeptide SKIM at
      its C-terminus, all characteristic of glycosomal enzymes. Amino
      acids predicted to be involved in the NAD(+)-dependent glycerol
      3-phosphate dehydrogenase active site have diverged from those of
      the mammalian enzyme. Kinetic analyses of the trypanosome GPD and
      CPD from rabbit muscle showed that the K-m values of the two enzymes
      are different. The data suggest that the trypanosome protein may be
      a candidate target for rational drug design. [References: 44]

AB  - A polyclonal antiserum raised against the purified glycosomal
      glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Trypanosoma brucei brucei has
      been used to identify the corresponding cDNA clone in a T.b. brucei
      expression library. This cDNA was subsequently used to obtain
      genomic clones containing glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes.
      Two tandemly arranged genes were detected in these clones.
      Characterization of one of the genes showed that it codes for a
      polypeptide of 353 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 37 651 Da
      and a calculated net charge of +8. Using the T.b. brucei gene as a
      probe, a corresponding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was
      also identified in a genomic library of Leishmania mexicana
      mexicana. The L.m. mexicana gene codes for a polypeptide of 365
      amino acids, with a molecular mass of 39 140 Da and a calculated net
      charge of +8. The amino-acid sequences of both polypeptides are 63%
      identical and carry a type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTSI) SKM
      and -SKL at their respective C-termini. Moreover, the L.m. mexicana
      polypeptide also carries a short N-terminal extension reminiscent of
      a mitochondrial transit sequence. Subcellular localisation analysis
      showed that in L.m. mexicana the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
      activity co-fractionated both with mitochondria and with glycosomes.
      This is not the case in T. brucei, where the enzyme is predominantly
      glycosomal. The two trypanosomatid sequences resemble their
      prokaryotic homologues (32-36%) more than their eukaryotic
      counterparts (25-31%) and carry typical prokaryotic signatures. The
      possible reason for this prokaryotic nature of a trypanosomatid
      glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is discussed. [References: 50]

AB  - This paper describes the isolation and characterisation of the meta1
      gene from Leishmania major, that is expressed predominantly in
      infective metacyclic parasites. The termini of the major 2-kb
      transcript derived from this gene have been mapped and
      polypyrimidine sequences implicated in RNA processing located in the
      flanking regions. The meta1 gene is conserved in both Old and New
      World Leishmania species and codes for a putative protein of 112
      amino acids. Antibodies raised against a recombinant protein
      expressed from this open reading frame recognise an 11.5-kDa protein
      in metacyclic cell lysates and this molecule localises to the region
      of the flagellar pocket by indirect immunofluorescence. [References:

AB  - Integration of exogenous DNA into the trypanosome genome occurs by
      homologous recombination only. To test whether a high degree of
      homology between donor and target DNA is required, we have inserted
      marker genes for drug resistance into the promoter area of variant
      surface glycoprotein (VSG) gene expression sites of Trypanosoma
      brucei, using targeting fragments from two expression sites that are
      92% identical. We observed integrations into expression sites that
      are known to be perfectly matched to the donor flanks, and into
      subsets of uncharacterized expression sites that are specific for
      each type of targeting fragment, and that could be similar or
      identical to the donor flanks. This requirement for very high
      homology was found in both procyclic and bloodstream-form
      trypanosomes. We speculate that trypanosomes have a mismatch repair
      system that suppresses recombination between divergent DNA
      sequences, and we discuss ways in which the trypanosome might
      circumvent the requirement for perfect DNA homology in the
      duplicative transposition of a VSG gene into a VSG gene expression
      site. [References: 73]

AB  - We studied the response of male DBA/2N mouse liver monooxygenases to
      acute (one-day) and subacute (7-day) exposure to clofibrate,
      gemfibrozil, and corn oil. The day following a single treatment with
      clofibrate (200 mg/kg), coumarin 7-hydroxylase (COH) activity
      decreased significantly (by 70%) with a concomitant decrease in the
      CYP2A4/5 protein and mRNA levels. The 7-day treatment schedule also
      decreased COH activity but only by 30%, though the levels of
      CYP2A4/5 protein and mRNA were still low. Treatment 1 and 7-day with
      clofibrate decreased 7-pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD) activity
      by 40%. No changes were seen in testosterone 15 alpha-hydroxylase
      (T15 alpha OH) activity after 1 day of treatment with clofibrate
      but, after 7 days, it was decreased by 50%. Clofibrate treatment had
      no significant effects on testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylase (T7 alpha
      OH), 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), or benzphetamine
      N-demethylase (BZDM) activities. Gemfibrozil (200 mg/kg) did not
      alter COH activity or CYP2A4/5 protein content after a single
      treatment, but a slight decrease was seen in the mRNA level.
      Treatment for 7 days significantly increased (2.5-fold) the activity
      and mRNA content but the amount of protein remained unchanged.
      Gemfibrozil enhanced (2-2.7-fold) PROD and EROD (2-2.5-fold)
      activities by both treatments, whereas T15 alpha OH, T7 alpha OH, or
      BZDM activities were not significantly affected. Treatment with corn
      oil for 7 days significantly decreased (65%) COH activity and
      CYP2A4/5 protein and mRNA levels. PROD (55%) and T15 alpha OH (65%)
      activities were significantly decreased even after a single dose
      although injection for 7 days had no effect. Neither of the corn oil
      schedules had any marked effect on T7 alpha OH, EROD, or BZDM
      activities. These results demonstrate: 1. a decrease in the
      expression of CYP2A4/5 gene by clofibrate and corn oil; 2.
      substantial differences within the CYP2A subfamily in their
      responses to corn oil, clofibrate, and gemfibrozil; and 3. distinct
      responses of other xenobiotic metabolizing CYP subfamily enzymes to
      clofibrate and gemfibrozil. [References: 44]

AB  - We previously showed that human liver hydroxymethylglutary-CoA
      (HMG-CoA) lyase (HL; EC 4.1.3.4) is found in both mitochondria and
      peroxisomes. HL contains a 27-residue N-terminal mitochondrial
      targeting sequence which is cleaved on mitochondrial entry, as well
      as a C-terminal Cys-Lys-Leu peroxisomal targeting motif. Because
      peroxisomal HL has a greater molecular mass and more basic pi value
      than mitochondrial HL, we predicted that peroxisomal HL retains the
      mitochondrial leader. To test this hypothesis, we expressed both the
      precursor (pHL) and mature (mHL) peptides in Escherichia coli and
      studied their properties. pHL purified by ion-exchange and
      hydrophobic chromatography had a pi of 7.6 on FPLC chromatofocusing
      and a molecular mass of 34.5 kDa on SDS/PAGE, similar to our
      findings for peroxisomal HL. For purified mHL, pi (6.2) and
      molecular mass (32 kDa) values resemble those of mitochondrial HL.
      Purified pHL is similar to mHL in K-m for HMG-CoA (44.8 mu M),
      k(cat) (6.3 min(-1)) and pH optimum (9.0-9.5). However, the
      quaternary structures of pHL and mHL differ. On Superose 12 FPLC gel
      filtration and also on ultrafiltration, both in the presence and in
      the absence of HMG-CoA, PHL behaves as a monomer whereas mHL
      migrates as a dimer. We conclude that the HL precursor is probably
      identical to peroxisomal HL, that its catalytic properties resemble
      those of mature mitochondrial HL, and that the mitochondrial leader
      peptide prevents dimerization of pHL. [References: 17]

AB  - 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase catalyzes the third reaction of
      fatty acid beta-oxidation spiral, There are three enzymes catalyzing
      the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase reaction: mitochondrial
      monofunctional 3-hydroxyacly-CoA dehydrogenase, mitochondrial
      enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA
      thiolase trifunctional protein, and peroxisomal enoyl-CoA
      hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional protein. The
      presence of isozymes of monofunctional 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
      dehydrogenase was not known. In the present study, two
      monofunctional mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases were
      purified from bovine liver. Type I enzyme was composed of two
      identical subunits with molecular mass of 35 kDa, and type II enzyme
      was a homotetramer of a 28 kDa polypeptide. In respect to the
      molecular structures, immunochemical properties, and carbon chain
      length specificities of acyl-CoA substrates, type I enzyme was the
      same as the well-known classical enzyme purified from various
      tissues, but type II enzyme was concluded to be a new enzyme. Type I
      enzyme was ubiquitous, but type II enzyme was rich in bovine and
      sheep, of several animal livers so far examined. [References: 18]

AB  - Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx) plays a protective
      role in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. In this study, we
      demonstrated that MDBK cells, a bovine renal epithelial cell line,
      exhibited internucleosomal DNA fragmentation characteristic of
      apoptotic cell death under selenium-deficient conditions with lower
      doses of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) than under selenium-supplemented
      ones. This was due to a decreased amount of GPx in the cells under
      selenium-deficient conditions, because other antioxidative enzyme
      activities were not affected by the selenium supplementation. Cumene
      hydroperoxide also induced DNA fragmentation in selenium-deficient
      cells but no ladder formation was observed. Flow cytometric analysis
      showed that selenium-deficient cells were less capable of scavenging
      intracellular peroxides after exposure to exogenous H2O2 than
      selenium-supplemented ones. In contrast, there was no difference in
      viability between selenium-supplemented and non-supplemented cells
      in cell survival after exposure to menadione, which activates the
      electron transport system and increases intracellular superoxide
      radicals. Clofibrate, a peroxisomal proliferator and an inducer of
      catalase (CAT), partially protected both Se-deficient and
      Se-supplemented cells from exogenous H2O2. We concluded that
      selenium-deficient cells were more easily brought to apoptotic cell
      death by peroxides, but not by superoxide radicals, than
      selenium-supplemented ones and that CAT could compensate for the
      depletion of GPx to a certain degree by scavenging H2O2.

AB  - The murine spontaneous B lymphoma is etiologically related to the
      expression of endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus (ETV),
      Although both SL/Kh and SL/Ni mouse strains show a high level of
      expression of ETV from early in life, the former is a pre-B
      lymphoma-prone strain and the latter is rather lymphoma-resistant.
      In order to identify the host background difference related to the
      lymphomagenesis, we performed a genetic cross study between these
      two strains, In the reciprocal F-1 generation, the length of the
      lymphoma latent period was slightly but significantly longer in
      (SL/Ni X SL/Kh)F-1 than in (SL/Kh X SL/Ni)F-1 (P < 0.05), The
      incidence of overall lymphomas and that of acute pre-B lymphomas was
      lower in (SL/Ni X SL/Kh)F-1 than in (SL/Kh X SL/Ni)F-1, although the
      difference was not statistically significant, These observations
      indicate that an epigenetic maternal resistance mechanism of SL/Ni
      mice plays a role in the lymphoma resistance, Furthermore, in the
      backcross combinations without maternal influence of SL/Ni, we
      observed a genetic mechanism of lymphoma resistance: an
      SL/Ni-derived recessive lymphoma-resistance gene mapped in the
      proximal segment of Chr. 4, We named this gene nir-1 (SL/Ni-lymphoma
      resistance-1), Thus, we have demonstrated epigenetic and genetic
      mechanisms of lymphoma resistance of the SL/Ni mouse with the high
      expression of endogenous ETV. [References: 12]

AB  - Japanese patients with peroxisomal disorders in the pediatric field
      were screened. Very long chain fatty acid analysis in the serum
      sphingomyelin was introduced since 1987 and was useful for the first
      screening of peroxisomal disorders. Seventy-five patients were
      diagnosed since 1980: 15 patients with Zellweger syndrome, 2 with
      neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), 1 with rhizomelic
      chondrodysplasia punctata, 1 with Zellweger-like syndrome, 2 with
      acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency, 2 with bifunctional enzyme deficiency
      and 52 with X-linked ALD. The incidence of peroxisome-deficient
      disorders was estimated to be approximately 1 in 800,000 births
      which is far less than that in the USA. However, the incidence in
      Okinawa Islands was 1 in 30,000, Japanese Zellweger patients
      belonged to 5 complementation groups (A, B, C, E, F) and the
      patients in Okinawa Islands belonged to groups A and C. The results
      of this screening were useful for genetic counseling, prenatal
      diagnosis, carrier detection and early medical care of patients with
      peroxisomal disorders. [References: 17]

AB  - Targeted disruption of the insulin receptor gene (Insr) in the mouse
      was achieved using the homologous recombination approach, Insr(+/-)
      mice were normal as shown by glucose tolerance tests, Normal
      Insr(-/-) pups were born at expected rates, indicating that Insr can
      be dispensable for intrauterine development, growth and metabolism,
      However, they rapidly developed diabetic ketoacidosis accompanied by
      a marked post-natal growth retardation (up to 30-40% of littermate
      size), skeletal muscle hypotrophy and fatty infiltration of the
      liver and they died within 7 days after birth. Total absence of the
      insulin receptor (IR), demonstrated in the homozygous mutant mice,
      also resulted in other metabolic disorders: plasma triglyceride
      level could increase 6-fold and hepatic glycogen content could be
      five times less as compared with normal littermates. The very
      pronounced hyperglycemia in Insr(-/-) mice could result in an
      increased plasma insulin level of up to similar to 300 mu U/ml, as
      compared with similar to 25 mu U/ml for normal littermates. However,
      this plasma insulin level was still unexpectedly low when compared
      with human infants with leprechaunism, who lack IR but who could
      have extremely high insulinemia (up to >4000 mu U/ml), The
      pathogenesis resulting from a null mutation in Insr is discussed.

AB  - The ability to target genes to the various layers, cell types, and
      appendages of the skin could be used to correct skin disorders,
      including those of aging such as wrinkling, as well as utilize
      specific cell types for production of molecules useful elsewhere in
      the body. However, the stratum corneum acts as a significant
      physical barrier to gene transfer into the skin. In this report we
      describe the ability to target and express the lacZ reporter gene to
      various depths of the dermis region in hairless mice. Skin-depth
      targeting is achieved by varying pulsed electrical fields and
      subsequent pressure from caliper-type electrodes on topically
      applied naked lacZ gene constructs. With electric pulses and
      extended pressure, the maximum depth of lacZ expression in the
      dermis and transfected cells was achieved at 370 mu m and 457
      cells/mm(2), respectively. Gene expression was observed only in the
      hair follicles in the case of the control. (C) 1996 Academic Press,

AB  - Mammalian phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C enzymes (PI-PLC)
      act as signal transducers that generate two second messengers,
      inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. The 2.4-Angstrom
      structure of phospholipase C delta 1 reveals a multidomain protein
      incorporating modules shared by many signalling proteins. The
      structure suggests a mechanism for membrane attachment and
      Ca2+-dependent hydrolysis of second-messenger precursors. The
      regulation and reversible membrane association of PI-PLC may serve
      as a model for understanding other multidomain enzymes involved in
      phospholipid signalling. [References: 50]

SO  - Nature 1996 Apr 18;380(6575):603-606
MH  - Universe.  Clusters.  Model.  Voids
AB  - Large-scale structure in the distribution of galaxies is thought to
      have evolved through gravitational instabilities from small density
      fluctuations in the (largely homogeneous) early Universe. This
      structure of galaxies consists of rich and poor clusters, connected
      by filaments and sheets, with regions largely devoid of galaxies
      (voids) in between(1). Numerical simulations of the growth of
      initial density fluctuations through a nonlinear regime, motivated
      by the likely physics of the early Universe, also show a network of
      filaments and voids(2,3,18), but the origin of this picture of
      filaments as the dominant structure was not well understood. Here we
      show that the 'web' of filaments that defines the final state in
      these simulations is present in the initial density fluctuations;
      the pattern of the web is defined largely by the rare density peaks
      in the initial fluctuations, with the subsequent nonlinear evolution
      of the structure bringing the filamentary net work into sharper
      relief. Applying these results to the observed galaxy distribution,
      we suggest that 'superclusters' are filamentary cluster-cluster
      bridges, and we predict that the most pronounced filaments will be
      found between clusters of galaxies that are aligned,vith each other
      and close together. [References: 18]

MH  - Brown dwarfs.  Accretion.  Evolution.  Disks.  Stars
AB  - The recent discovery(1) and confirmation(2) of a possible planetary
      companion orbiting the solar-type star 51 Pegasi represent a
      breakthrough in the search for extrasolar planetary systems.
      Analysis of systematic variations in the velocity of the star
      indicate that the mass of the companion is approximately that of
      Jupiter, and that it is travelling in a nearly circular orbit at a
      distance from the star of 0.05 AU (about seven stellar radii). Here
      we show that, if the companion is indeed a gas-giant planet, it is
      extremely unlikely to have formed at its present location. We
      suggest instead that the planet probably formed by gradual accretion
      of solids and capture of gas at a much larger distance from the star
      (similar to 5 AU) and that it subsequently migrated inwards through
      interactions with the remnants of the circumstellar disk. The
      planet's migration may have stopped in its present orbit as a result
      of tidal interactions with the star, or through truncation of the
      inner circumstellar disk by the stellar magnetosphere. [References:

MH  - Eigenfunctions.  Systems.  Orbits.  Space.  Gaas
AB  - Qualitative insight into the properties of a quantum-mechanical
      system can be gained from the study of the relationship between the
      system's classical newtonian dynamics, and its quantum dynamics as
      described by the Schrodinger equation. The Bohr-Sommerfeld
      quantization scheme--which underlies the historically important Bohr
      model for hydrogen-like atoms--describes the relationship between
      the classical and quantum-mechanical regimes, but only for systems
      with stable, periodic or quasiperiodic orbits'. Only recently has
      progress been made in understanding the quantization of systems that
      exhibit non-periodic, chaotic motion. The spectra of quantized
      energy levels for such systems are irregular, and show fluctuations
      associated with unstable periodic orbits of the corresponding
      classical system(1-3). These orbits appear as 'scars'-concentrations
      of probability amplitude--in the wavefunction of the system(4).
      Although wavefunction scarring has been the subject of extensive
      theoretical investigation(5-10), it has not hitherto been observed
      experimentally in a quantum system. Here we use tunnel-current
      spectroscopy to map the quantum-mechanical energy levels of an
      electron confined in a semiconductor quantum well in a high magnetic
      held(10-13). We find clear experimental evidence for wavefunction
      scarring, in full agreement with theoretical predictions(10).

MH  - Photoinduced charge separation.  Electrodes.  Layers
AB  - Attempts to mimic the highly efficient process of
      photosynthesis(1-3) are of considerable interest, the goal being to
      design artificial systems for the efficient conversion of solar
      energy into chemical or electrical energy(4-14). In both natural and
      artificial systems, the underlying process is photoinduced charge
      separation, typically involving a redox reaction between a
      photoexcited donor molecule and an acceptor molecule. Through
      careful choice of the molecular arrangement, and the redox
      potentials of the donors, intermediate charge carriers and
      accepters, it is possible to minimize the reverse electron transfer
      process and thereby obtain stable photoinduced charge separation. In
      this context, photochemical electron accepters based on
      methylviologen and its derivatives have been widely
      studied(5,6,8-12,14-19). Here we describe the synthesis and
      characterization of metal biphosphonate multilayer thin films
      composed of viologen-based acceptor layers and donor layers of
      p-phenylenediamine. Our method of film growth provides control over
      both the structure and composition of the multilayer films, leading
      to efficient photoinduced charge separation and directional electron
      transport. These films generate photocurrents when irradiated with
      ultraviolet and visible light. [References: 25]

MH  - Continental-shelf.  Winyah bay.  Discharge.  Estuarine.  Sediments. 
MH  - Radium.  Flux
AB  - The flow of ground water directly into the coastal ocean has been
      studied previously by in situ measurements, seep meters and
      diffusion gradient models'. Although these techniques provide ample
      evidence that such flows occur, they do not provide a means of
      quantifying the groundwater flux on a regional scale. Here I report
      large enrichments of Ra-226 in coastal waters of the South Atlantic
      Eight, and demonstrate that groundwater discharge is the main source
      of the Ra-226 surplus. Using Ra-226 data for brackish ground waters
      with estimates of residence times of nearshore waters, I conclude
      that the groundwater flux to these coastal waters must be about 40%
      of the river-water flux during the study period. Besides Ra, other
      metals, nutrients and organic compounds are expected to be enriched
      in brackish ground waters, so these findings require an upward
      revision of terrestrial fluxes of dissolved materials to these
      coastal waters, and perhaps a re-evaluation of such fluxes to the
      global ocean. These fluxes may be sensitive to hydrological factors,
      groundwater usage, dredging and sea-level change. [References: 16]

MH  - Record
AB  - The end of the Triassic period is pivotal in the evolution of modern
      ecosystems'. Despite this, the Triassic remains one of the poorest
      known periods in the evolutionary history of the terrestrial
      arthropods. Here we report on fossiliferous shales preserving a
      nearly complete marginal lacustrine community from the
      Virginia-North Carolina border that sheds considerable light on this
      critical interval. Three species of insect were previously described
      from this locality, but the full extent and significance of its
      diversity have only now been discovered: we report here the oldest
      definitive records for three orders of insect and numerous families
      and superfamilies. Furthermore, in addition to new taxa, the flora
      is shown to contain an unusual diversity of forms, some of which
      have only been previously reported either from Europe or the
      Southern Hemisphere. The abundance of complete insects and the
      preservation of soft-part anatomy on some of the vertebrates
      elevates the site to one of the most significant Lagerstatte in the
      world. [References: 27]

SO  - Nature 1996 Apr 18;380(6575):619-621
MH  - Behavior.  Colonies
AB  - Close inbreeding is known for a variety of small mammal species(1-4)
      for which a high probability of mortality during dispersal makes
      helping and delayed maturation a relatively secure fitness
      option(5). Prolonged inbreeding, however, is usually associated with
      lowered fitness(6,7), and it has been shown that most highly inbred
      small mammals(8) and social insects(9) have inbreeding-avoidance
      mechanisms that promote some degree of outbreeding. However,
      previous field and laboratory research on the naked mole-rat
      (Heterocephalus glaber) suggested that this cooperatively breeding
      rodent is highly inbred(10-12), with new colonies forming by
      fission(13). Here we report the discovery of a dispersal phenotype
      that may occasionally promote outbreeding in naked mole-rats. These
      dispersers are morphologically, physiologically and behaviourally
      distinct from other colony members. They are laden with fat, exhibit
      elevated levels of luteinizing hormone, have a strong urge to
      disperse, and only solicit matings with non-colony members. These
      findings suggest that, although rare, a dispersive morph exists
      within naked mole-rat colonies. [References: 20]

TI  - WHAT IS RIVALLING DURING BINOCULAR RIVALRY
SO  - Nature 1996 Apr 18;380(6575):621-624
MH  - Spatial-frequency.  Suppression.  Perception.  Duration.  Stimuli
AB  - When different images are presented to the two eyes, they compete
      for perceptual dominance, such that one image is visible while the
      other is suppressed. This binocular rivalry is thought to reflect
      competition between monocular neurons within the primary visual
      cortex(1). However, neurons whose activity correlates with
      perception during rivalry are found mainly in higher cortical areas,
      and respond to input from both eyes(2,3). Thus rivalry may involve
      competition between alternative perceptual interpretations at a
      higher level of analysis. To investigate this, we tested the effect
      of rapidly alternating the rival stimuli between the two eyes. Under
      these conditions, the perceptual alternations exhibit the same
      temporal dynamics as with static patterns, and a single phase of
      perceptual dominance can span multiple alternations of the stimuli.
      Thus neural representations of the two stimuli compete for visual
      awareness independently of the eye through which they reach the
      higher visual areas. This finding places binocular rivalry in the
      general category of multistable phenomena, such as ambiguous
      figures, and provides a new way to study the neural cause and
      resolution of perceptual ambiguities. [References: 22]

SO  - Nature 1996 Apr 18;380(6575):624-627
MH  - Beta-gamma.  Receptors.  Expression
AB  - Cholinergic muscarinic, serotonergic, opioid and several other
      G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors activate inwardly
      rectifying K+ channels of the GIRK family, slowing the heartbeat and
      decreasing the excitability of neuronal cells'. Inhibitory
      modulation of GIRKs by G-protein-coupled receptors may have
      important implications in cardiac and brain physiology, Previously G
      alpha and G beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins have
      both been implicated in channel opening(2,3), but recent studies
      attribute this role primarily to the G beta gamma dimer that
      activates GIRKs in a membrane-delimited fashion, probably by direct
      binding to the channel protein(4-8). We report here that free GTP
      gamma S-activated G(alpha i1), but not G(alpha i2) or G(alpha i3),
      potently inhibits G(beta 1 gamma 2)-induced GIRK activity in excised
      membrane patches of Xenopus oocytes expressing GIRK1. High-affinity
      but partial inhibition is produced by G(alpha s)-GTP gamma S.
      G(alpha i1)-GTP gamma S also inhibits G(beta 1 gamma 2)-activated
      GIRK in atrial myocytes. Antagonistic interactions between G(alpha)
      and G(beta gamma) may be among the mechanisms determining
      specificity of G protein coupling to GIRKs. [References: 30]

MH  - Resting b-cells.  Interleukin-4.  Expression.  Lipopolysaccharide. 
MH  - Lymphokine.  Receptor
AB  - Interleukin-4(IL-4) is a pleiotropic lymphokine which plays an
      important role in the immune system(1). IL-4 activates two distinct
      signalling pathways through tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6, a
      signal transducer and activator of transcription, and of a 170K
      protein called 4PS(2-7). To investigate the functional role of Stat6
      in IL-4 signalling, we generated mice deficient in Stat6 by gene
      targeting. We report here that in the mutant mice, expression of
      CD23 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II in resting
      B cells was not enhanced in response to IL-4. IL-4-induced B-cell
      proliferation costimulated by anti-IgM antibody was abolished. The
      T-cell proliferative response was also notably reduced. Furthermore,
      production of Th2 cytokines from T cells as well as IgE and IgG1
      responses after nematode infection were profoundly reduced. These
      findings agreed with those obtained in IL4-deficient mice(8,9) or
      using antibodies to IL-4(10) and the IL-4 receptor(11). We conclude
      that Stat6 plays a central role in exerting IL-4-mediated biological
      responses. [References: 28]

MH  - Il-4.  Generation.  Invivo.  Cells
AB  - Signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats) are
      activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to cytokines, and
      are thought to mediate many of their functional responses(1-4) Stat6
      is activated in response to interleukin (IL)-4 (refs 5,6) and may
      contribute to various functions including mitogenesis, T-helper cell
      differentiation and immunoglobulin isotype switching(7). To evaluate
      the role of Stat6, we generated Stat6-null mice (Stat6(-/-)) by gene
      disruption in embryonic stem cells. The mice were viable, indicating
      the lack of a non-redundant function in normal development. Although
      naive lymphoid cell development was normal, Stat6(-/-) mice were
      deficient in IL-4-mediated functions including Th2 helper T-cell
      differentiation, expression of cell surface markers, and
      immunoglobulin class switching to IgE. In contrast, IL-4-mediated
      proliferation was only partly affected. [References: 29]

TI  - CALCIUM MOBILIZATION VIA SPHINGOSINE KINASE IN SIGNALLING BY THE
      FC-EPSILON-RI ANTIGEN RECEPTOR
SO  - Nature 1996 Apr 18;380(6575):634-636
MH  - Cell.  Transduction.  Platelets
AB  - Calcium mobilization through antigen receptors, including
      high-affinity IgE receptors (Fc epsilon RI), is thought to be
      mediated by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate production (InsP(3))(1-4).
      Here we show that antigen clustering of Fc epsilon RI on the rat
      mast-cell line (RBC 2H3) activates a sphingosine kinase (SK) and
      produces sphingosine-l-phosphate (S1P), an alternative second
      messenger for intracellular calcium mobilization, The sphingosine
      analogue, D-L-threo-dihydrosphingosine (DHS), inhibits the SK enzyme
      competitively with a dissociation constant, K-i, of 5 to 18 mu M.
      This inhibition substantially suppresses the Fc epsilon RI-mediated
      calcium signal, but leaves intact the syk tyrosine kinase activation
      and the small InsP(3) production. The entire InsP(3)-dependent
      pathway activated by a transfected G-protein coupled receptor, used
      here as a positive control, also remained intact. Thus Fc epsilon RI
      principally utilizes a SK pathway to mobilize calcium. [References:

MH  - Calcium-binding.  Peptide complex.  Calmodulin.  Elegans
AB  - Protein phosphorylation by protein kinases plays a central
      regulatory role in cellular processes and these kinases are
      themselves tightly regulated(1). One common mechanism of regulation
      involves Ca2+-binding proteins (CaBP) such as calmodulin (CaM)(2).
      Here we report a Ca2+-effector mechanism for protein kinase
      activation by demonstrating the specific and >1,000-fold activation
      of the myosin-associated giant protein kinase twitchin by
      Ca2+/S100A1(2). S100A1(2) is a member of a large CaBP family that is
      implicated in various cellular processes, including cell growth,
      differentiation and motility, but whose molecular actions are
      largely unknown(3). The S100A1(2)-binding site is a part of the
      autoregulatory sequence positioned in the active site that is
      responsible for intrasteric autoinhibition of twitchin kinase; the
      mechanism of autoinhibition based on the crystal structures of two
      twitchin kinase fragments is described elsewhere(4). Ca2+/S100
      represents a likely physiological activator for the entire family of
      giant protein kinases involved in muscle contractions and
      cytoskeletal structure(2,5-9). [References: 26]

AB  - There is a wealth of data supporting a central role for the prion
      protein (PrP) in the neurodegenerative prion diseases of both humans
      and other species(1), yet the normal function of PrP, which is
      expressed at the cell surface of neurons and glial cells(2,3), is
      unknown. It has been speculated that neuropathology may be due to
      loss of normal function of PrP (ref. 4). Here we show that in mice
      devoid of PrP there is an alteration in both circadian activity
      rhythms and sleep patterns. To our knowledge, this is the first null
      mutation that has been shown to affect sleep regulation and our
      results indicate that the pathology of at least one of the inherited
      prion diseases, fatal familial insomnia(5), where there is a
      profound alteration in sleep and the daily rhythms of many
      hormones(6-10), may be related to the normal function of the prion
      protein. [References: 28]

MH  - Virus type-i.  Long terminal repeat.  Transcriptional activation.

AB  - The Tax protein of human T-lymphotrophic virus (HTLV)-1 activates
      expression of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat through a DNA element
      that resembles the cellular cyclic AMP-regulated enhancer
      (CRE)(1,2). Tax contains a transcriptional activation domain(3), but
      its ability to activate gene expression depends on interactions with
      cellular CRE-binding proteins such as CREB. Whether Tax can activate
      the expression of cellular CRE-containing genes has been
      controversial. Here we show that Tax can activate both the HTLV-1
      and consensus cellular CREs, and propose that this activation may
      occur through mechanisms that are differentially dependent on CREB
      phosphorylation. Tax not only increases the binding of CREB to the
      viral CRE but also recruits the transcriptional co-activator CBP4,5
      in a manner independent of CREB phosphorylation. In contrast,
      association of Tax with the cellular CRE occurs through CBP which,
      in turn, is recruited only in the presence of phosphorylated CREB.

AB  - Many proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing contain one or more
      copies of a 70-90-amino-acid alpha beta module called the
      ribonucleoprotein domain(1-4). RNA maturation depends on the
      specific recognition by ribonucleoproteins of RNA elements within
      pre-mRNAs and small nuclear RNAs. The human U1A protein binds an RNA
      hairpin during splicing(5-8), and regulates its own expression by
      binding an internal loop(9) in the 3'-untranslated region of its pre
      mRNA, preventing polyadenylation3. Here we report the nuclear
      magnetic resonance structure of the complex between the regulatory
      element of the U1A 3'-untranslated region (UTR)(9-11) and the U1A
      protein RNA-binding domain. Specific intermolecular recognition
      requires the interaction of the variable loops of the
      ribonucleoprotein domain with the well-structured helical regions of
      the RNA. Formation of the complex then orders the flexible RNA
      single-stranded loop against the protein beta-sheet surface, and
      reorganizes the carboxy-terminal region of the protein to maximize
      surface complementarity and functional group recognition.

AB  - The biocatalytic production of glyoxylic acid from glycolic acid
      requires two enzymes: glycolate oxidase, which catalyzes the
      oxidation of glycolic acid by oxygen to produce glyoxylic acid and
      hydrogen peroxide, and catalase, which decomposes the byproduct
      hydrogen peroxide. As an alternative to isolation from the leaf
      peroxisomes of spinach, glycolate oxidase has now been cloned and
      expressed in transformants of Aspergillus nidulans T580 at levels
      ranging from 1.7 to 36 IU/g dry wt. cells. The glycolate oxidase of
      transformant strain T17 comprises ca. 1.9% of total cell protein and
      is expressed at near 100% activity. (C) 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

      chain (gamma(c)) of the receptor for interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4,
      IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the
      current therapy of choice for this defect, is often complicated by
      graft-versus-host disease and/or incomplete reconstitution of
      B-lymphocyte functions. Correction of the gene defect at the level
      of the autologous lymphohematopoietic progenitors could therefore
      represent an improvement in the medical management of these
      patients. To study the feasibility of a gene therapy approach for
      XSCID, a retroviral vector expressing gamma(c) was used to transduce
      Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines derived from patients
      with XSCID. After transduction, XSCID cells newly expressed gamma(c)
      on the cell surface at levels comparable to those observed on B-cell
      lines obtained from normal donors. Moreover, the reconstituted
      gamma(c) restored function to the IL-2 and IL-4 receptors as shown
      by signal transduction mediated by phosphorylation of the JAK1 and
      JAK3 members of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases and by
      restoration of cellular proliferation in response to IL-2.

AB  - X-SCID, the most common form of human SCID, is due to mutations in
      the common gamma chain gene (gamma(c)) that encodes an essential
      component of the cytokine receptors for interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4,
      IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. Activation of the Janus family tyrosine
      kinases Jak1 and Jak3 is necessary for appropriate signalling
      through the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R). Neither Jak1 nor Jak3 was
      phosphorylated after IL-2 stimulation of an Epstein-Barr
      virus-transformed cell line (LCL) from an X-SCID patient with a
      gamma(c) null mutation. However, we now show that appropriate IL-2R
      function can be restored in an X-SCID LCL by transduction of a
      wild-type gamma(c) gene. A retroviral vector, G1 gamma(c)SvNa, was
      constructed and produced in the PG13 packaging line. Transduced
      X-SCID LCL expressed the G1 gamma(c)SvNa transcript. IL-2
      stimulation of the transduced cell line resulted in appropriate
      tyrosine phosporylation of both Jak1 and Jak3. Thus,
      retroviral-mediated transduction of normal gamma(c) can reconstitute
      downstream signalling through the IL-2R in X-SCID cell lines,
      suggesting that gene therapy may be a treatment for this disease.

MH  - Membrane-protein.  Mutations.  Superfamily.  Member
AB  - The adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) and the 70-kDa peroxisomal
      membrane protein are half ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in
      the human peroxisome membrane, Both are implicated in genetic
      disorders of peroxisome biogenesis and function, Proteins homologous
      to ALDP and the 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein have been
      discovered in other eukaryotic organisms and form a growing group of
      peroxisomal half ABC transporters. Amino acid sequence alignment of
      these and other ABC transporters reveals several protein motifs that
      are highly conserved both in sequence and location. Here we
      characterize two of these, designated the EAA-like and the loop1
      motifs. We study them by introducing missense mutations in Pxa1p, a
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of ALDP, and show that both motifs
      are important for Pxa1p function. Interestingly, missense mutations
      in corresponding amino acids in ALDP cause adrenoleukodystrophy in
      humans. We conclude that these motifs are important for ABC trans
      porter function and that the yeast protein Pxa1p is a useful system
      for understanding the molecular basis of adrenoleukodystrophy.

AB  - We have cloned and characterized the Hansenula polymorpha PERS gene
      by functional complementation of the per9-1 mutant of H. polymorpha,
      which is defective in peroxisome biogenesis. The predicted product,
      Per9p, is a polypeptide of 52 Id)a with sequence similarity to
      Pas3p, a protein involved in peroxisome biogenesis in Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae, In a per9 disruption strain (Delta per9), peroxisomal
      matrix and membrane proteins are present at wild-type levels, The
      matrix proteins accumulated in the cytoplasm, However, the location
      of the membrane proteins remained obscure; fully induced Delta per9
      cells lacked residual peroxisomal vesicles (''ghosts''), Analysis of
      the activity of the PER9 promoter revealed that PER9 expression was
      low in cells grown on glucose, but was enhanced during growth of
      cells on peroxisome-inducing substrates, The highest expression
      levels were observed in cells grown on methanol, Localization
      studies revealed that Per9p is an integral membrane protein of the
      peroxisome. Targeting studies suggested that Per9p may be sorted to
      the peroxisome via the endoplasmic reticulum, Overexpression of PER9
      induced a significant increase in the number of peroxisomes per
      cell, a result that suggests that Per9p may be involved in
      peroxisome proliferation and/or membrane biosynthesis, When PERS
      expression was placed under the control of a strongly regulatable
      promoter and switched off, peroxisomes were observed to disintegrate
      over time in a manner that suggested that Per9p may be required for
      maintenance of the peroxisomal membrane. [References: 48]

AB  - The POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) family transcription factor Brn-3a contains
      two distinct activation domains, one at the N terminus of the
      molecule and one at the C terminus coincident with the DNA binding
      domain, These different activation domains have been shown
      previously to differ in their ability to activate an artificial test
      promoter containing a Brn-3a binding site and the naturally
      occurring alpha-internexin gene promoter, Here we identify the
      target site for Brn-3a in the alpha-internexin gene promoter and
      show that it can confer responsiveness to Brn-3a on a heterologous
      promoter, One of the single-stranded DNA sequences derived from
      either this novel Brn-3a binding site or from the previously
      characterized site in the test promoter are shown to bind Brn-3a
      preferentially compared with the complementary single strand or the
      corresponding double-stranded sequence. The pattern of
      responsiveness of these two sequences when cloned upstream of the
      same test promoter and co-transfected with constructs encoding
      various portions of Brn-3a indicates that the activity of the two
      Brn-3a activation domains is dependent upon differences in the
      context of the target sequence in each promoter rather than on
      differences in the target sequence itself. [References: 38]

AB  - X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) is an inherited
      disease characterized by profoundly diminished cell-mediated and
      humoral immunity. XSCID was found to result from mutations in the
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor gamma chain. Knowledge of the genetic
      defect has important implications for prenatal and postnatal
      diagnosis, carrier female identification, and the possibility of
      gene therapy. The fact that the phenotype and clinical
      manifestations in XSCID are more severe than the abnormalities found
      in humans or mice deficient in IL-2 led to the speculation and
      subsequent confirmation that the IL-2 receptor is not the only
      receptor to contain the gamma-chain. Instead, the gamma chain is
      also a component of the receptors for IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15
      and is now denoted as the common cytokine receptor gamma chain,
      gamma(c). The role of gamma(c) in signaling and lymphoid development
      and the implications of a shared receptor component are discussed.

      surfactant lipids and protein that is similar to pulmonary alveolar
      proteinosis in humans. We asked how GM-CSF deficiency alters
      surfactant metabolism and function in mice. Alveolar and lung tissue
      saturated phosphatidylcholine (Sat PC) were increased six- to
      eightfold in 7- to 9-wk-old GM-CSF-deficient mice relative to
      controls. Incorporation of radiolabeled palmitate and choline into
      Sat PC was higher in GM-CSF deficient mice than control mice, and no
      loss of labeled Sat PC occurred from the lungs of GM-CSF-deficient
      mice. Secretion of radiolabeled Sat PC to the alveolus was similar
      in GM-CSF-deficient and control mice. Labeled Sat PC and surfactant
      protein A (SP-A) given by tracheal instillation were cleared rapidly
      in control mice, but there was no measurable loss from the lungs of
      GM-CSF-deficient mice. The function of the surfactant from
      GM-CSF-deficient mice was normal when tested in preterm
      surfactant-deficient rabbits. GM-CSF deficiency results in a
      catabolic defect for Sat PC and SP-A. [References: 32]

AB  - Skin cancer represents an increasingly urgent worldwide public
      health problem.(1) Estimates project almost a million (or more) new
      cases each year in the United States; this number is roughly equal
      to that of all other cancers combined.(2) The incidence of cutaneous
      melanoma, which is mounting faster than that of any other cancer in
      white persons, nearly doubled from 1973 to 1990; in addition, the
      rise in melanoma mortality rates in white persons ranks second only
      to lung cancer.(3) While the overall 5-year melanoma survival rates
      in the United States rose from 49% (in the early 1950s) to 82% (in
      the early 1990s), death rates more than doubled during the same
      time; these rates were driven up by the rising incidence.(1,4) This
      year in the United States, melanoma will strike 34 000 persons and
      kill 7200-part of an estimated 90 000 cases diagnosed
      worldwide.(5,6) Despite exciting advances in innovative treatment
      approaches (eg, immuno-therapy and gene therapy), metastatic
      melanoma remains largely incurable.(1) Decades of research have not
      only crystallized an understanding of the epidemiology, risk
      factors, and natural history of skin cancer but also have begun to
      stimulate international efforts to promote its prevention and
      control, In theory, the public health burden of melanoma and skin
      cancer could be lowered through some combination of effective
      primary and secondary prevention measures. Reduction of excessive
      sun exposure (primary prevention) could theoretically reduce the
      incidence, since experts hypothesize that 90% of the cases of
      nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and two thirds of the cases of
      melanoma may be attributed to excessive sunlight exposure.(6,7)
      Primary prevention strategies can include personal behavior changes
      for individuals leg, minimizing UV exposure and using sunscreen), as
      well as policy and environmental interventions for populations leg,
      provision of shady areas and preservation of the ozone layer). Early
      detection (secondary prevention) should increase melanoma cure
      rates, since long-term survival figures of 92% for localized
      melanoma decline sharply to lower than 5% for metastatic disease.(3)
      Furthermore, these external, visible cancers have identifiable risk
      factors, should be readily recognizable by the public and health
      professionals alike, and are easily treated in the early stages.(8)
      We summarize the current state of melanoma and skin cancer control
      around the world. [References: 89]

AB  - Nongenotoxic carcinogens are chemicals that induce neoplasia without
      it or its metabolites reacting directly with DNA. Chemicals
      classified as nongenotoxic carcinogens have been assumed to act as
      tumor promoters and exhibit threshold tumor dose-responses. This is
      in contrast to genotoxic carcinogens that are DNA reactive, act as
      tumor initiators, and are assumed to exhibit proportional responses
      at low doses. In this perspective, we examine the basic tenets and
      utility of this classification for evaluating human cancer risk. Two
      classes of so-called nongenotoxic chemical carcinogens selected for
      review include cytotoxic agents that induce regenerative hyperplasia
      (trihalomethanes and inducers of alpha(2)-microglobulin nephropathy)
      and agents that act via receptor-mediated mechanisms (peroxisome
      proliferators and dioxin). Major conclusions of this review include:
      a) many chemicals considered to be nongenotoxic carcinogens actually
      possess certain genotoxic activities, and limiting evaluations of
      carcinogenicity to their nongenotoxic effects can be misleading; b)
      some nongenotoxic activities may cause oxidative DNA damage and
      thereby initiate carcinogenesis; c) although cell replication is
      involved in tumor development. cytotoxicity and mitogenesis do not
      reliably predict carcinogenesis; d) a threshold tumor response is
      not an inevitable result of a receptor-mediated mechanism. There are
      insufficient data on the chemicals reviewed here to justify treating
      their carcinogenic effects in animals as irrelevant for evaluating
      human risk. Research findings that characterize the multiple
      mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis should be used quantitatively
      to clarify human dose-response relationships, leading to improved
      scientifically based public health decisions. Excessive reliance on
      over-simplified classification schemes that do not consider all
      potential contributing effects of a toxicant can obscure the actual
      causal relationships between exposure and cancer outcome.

AB  - When [1-C-14]7,10,13,16,19-22:5 was incubated with microsomes, it
      was not desaturated to 4,7,10,13,16,19-22:6 by an acyl-CoA-dependent
      4-desaturase. Subsequent studies with rat hepatocytes showed that
      7,10,13,16,19-22:5 was the precursor of 4,7,10,13,16,19-22:6, but
      the pathway proceeded through 24-carbon fatty acids. The implication
      of this finding is that 24-carbon acids, when produced in
      microsomes, must move to a site for partial beta-oxidation.
      Subsequent studies using a number of labeled acids showed that
      peroxisomes chain-shorten fatty acids, which then move back to the
      endoplasmic reticulum for esterification. The biosynthesis of both
      22:5(n-6) and 22:6(n-3) thus requires the extensive movement of
      fatty acids between subcellular compartments. [References: 16]

AB  - We have cloned, sequenced and characterized a gene from Trypanosoma
      cruzi (Y strain), termed tcpgp2, which encodes a member of the ABC
      (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily of evolutionarily conserved
      transport proteins. The nucleotide sequence of the tcpgp2 gene was
      determined. It presents a 4602-bp open reading frame, coding for a
      1534-amino acid protein, with a predicted molecular mass of 169 470
      Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of tcpgp2 exhibited a remarkable
      homology with the P-glycoprotein-related genes of Leishmania
      tarentolae, the yeast cadmium factor (YCF1) and the human multidrug
      resistance-associated protein (MRP). Southern blot analysis using a
      specific probe indicated that the Tcpgp2 P-glycoprotein is encoded
      by a single copy gene which maps to a chromosome of about 900 kb.
      Northern blot analysis revealed that tcpgp2 gene is expressed as a
      polyadenylated transcript of approximately 5 kb in dividing
      amastigote and epimastigote forms; we did not detect the transcript
      in the non-dividing trypomastigote forms of the parasite. Gene
      transfection experiments in Leishmania tropica indicated that, under
      the conditions tested, tcpgp2 gene is not involved in drug
      resistance. [References: 41]

AB  - The study aimed to systematically examine the effects of fat soluble
      vitamins and their analogs on terminal differentiation of adipocytes
      on the cellular and molecular aspects, It is well known that fat
      soluble vitamins especially vitamins A and D inhibit the
      differentiation of adipocytes in cultured cells, Furthermore, it has
      been revealed that the low level of dietary fat soluble vitamins,
      especially vitamin A and carotenoid actively stimulate the
      development of adipose tissue, namely bovine marbling in vivo. We
      have shown that the expression of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha
      and gamma. retinoid X receptor (RXR) alpha and beta, and vitamin D
      receptor (VDR) mRNA were abundant in rat adipose tissue and 3T3-L1
      cells, The autoregulated amplification and reduction of RAR, RXR and
      VDR mRNA by their own ligands, were observed in 3T3-L1 cells,
      Finally, we proposed the model of vitamins A and D as suppressors on
      adipocyte development through retinoid/thyroid/vitamin D/fatty
      acid-activated/peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor's
      subfamily. [References: 22]

AB  - Colorectal tumors frequently have loss of heterozygosity on
      chromosome 22q, suggesting that inactivation of tumor suppressor
      gene(s) on 22q participates in the tumor development.
      Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene and E1A binding protein p300 gene,
      recently identified on 22q, are thought to be candidates for tumor
      suppressor genes. In this study, mutation of the NF2 gene in 59
      colorectal carcinomas, and mutation of the p300 gene in 27
      colorectal and two gastric carcinomas, were analysed using PCR-SSCP,
      RT-PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing methods. Missense mutations of
      p300 gene were detected in a colorectal carcinoma, and in a gastric
      carcinoma, though no mutation of NF2 gene was detected. Both p300
      mutations were somatic and coupled to deletion of the second allele
      of the gene, which suggests inactivation of the p300 gene in these
      carcinomas. The mutations are located within the Cys/His-rich
      regions, which are assumed to play important roles in the function
      of p300. These are the first cases in which p300 gene has been found
      to be altered in both alleles, suggesting that inactivation of the
      p300 gene may be involved in the development of carcinomas, and that
      this gene may be the target of loss of 22q in carcinomas of the
      digestive tract. [References: 26]

AB  - Purpose. The effects of transfection with the human Cu,
      Zn-superoxide dismutase (hSOD)(4) gene on active oxygen-induced
      cytotoxicity in rat skin fibroblasts (FR) were studied for the
      purpose of developing the novel delivery system of hSOD using hSOD
      gene.

      Methods. An expression plasmid for hSOD, pRc/RSV-SOD, was
      constructed and used to transfect FR cells. Xanthine (X)/xanthine
      oxidase (XO) system were used to generate active oxygen species. The
      effects of transfection with the hSOD gene on active oxygen-induced
      cytotoxicity were assessed by comparing the number of surviving
      cells and the level of lipid peroxidation in host and transformants
      after exposure to X/XO system.

      Results. The cellular SOD activity in RSV-SOD cells transfected with
      pRc/RSV-SOD was significantly increased in comparison with host or
      RSV cells transfected with the pRc/RSV plasmid containing no hSOD
      gene as a control. Furthermore, Western blot analysis using an
      anti-hSOD antibody indicated the production of hSOD in RSV-SOD
      cells. On the other hand, although the numbers of surviving cells in
      both host and RSV-SOD cultures after exposure to X/XO system
      decreased in a time-dependent manner, the decrease in number of
      surviving RSV SOD cells was less than that in host cells. In the
      presence of catalase, the decreases in number of surviving cells in
      both host and RSV-SOD cultures after exposure to the X/XO system
      were also less than those in the absence of catalase. However, the
      decreases in cell survival in RSV-SOD cultures were significantly
      less than those in host cells in the presence of catalase.
      Furthermore, the levels of lipid peroxidation in RSV-SOD cells
      exposed to the X/XO system in the presence or absence of catalase
      were lower than those in host cells. These results indicated that
      the increase in cellular SOD activity by transfection with the hSOD
      gene protects cells from oxidative stress.

      Conclusions. Human SOD gene therapy may be useful for treatment of
      diseases in which oxidative tissue damage is produced. [References:

AB  - Combination therapy involving adenovirus-mediated transfer of the
      genes for herpes thymidine kinase (tk) and murine interleukin 2
      (mIL-2) was used to treat head and neck cancer in C3H/HeJ mice,
      Tumors were generated by transcutaneous injection of 5 x 10(5)
      murine squamous carcinoma cells into the floor of the mouth of these
      syngeneic mice. After 1 week, recombinant adenoviral vectors
      containing both therapeutic and control genes in various
      combinations were injected directly into the established tumors, and
      subsequently all mice were administered ganciclovir twice daily (25
      mg/kg) for 6 days, Animals receiving either tk alone or tk + mIL-2
      demonstrated significant tumor regression compared to mIL-2 alone or
      control vector-treated mice (P < 0.008), Mice receiving both tk +
      mIL-2, however, also demonstrated a significantly greater regression
      of tumors compared to those treated with tk alone (P < 0.008),
      indicating a synergistic effect of the combination gene therapy,
      This synergism was confirmed in survival studies because Ik +
      mIL-2-treated mice showed increased survivals (P = 0.0002). Clinical
      and microscopic exam of regional surrounding tissues and distant
      organs showed no evidence of cytotoxicity for representative animals
      in each experimental group, These results suggest that combination
      tk and mIL-2 gene therapy may provide a powerful new modality for
      the treatment of head and neck cancer. [References: 20]

AB  - Specific transfer and expression of bacterial luciferase genes via
      bacteriophages provides an efficient way to detect and assay viable
      host cells. Listeria bacteriophage A511 is a genus-specific,
      virulent myovirus which infects 95% of Listeria monocytogenes
      serovar 1/2 and 4 cells. We constructed recombinant derivative
      A511:: luxAB, which carries the gene for a fused Vibrio harveyi
      LuxAB protein inserted immediately downstream of the major capsid
      protein gene (cps). Efficient transcription is initiated by the
      powerful cps promoter at 15 to 20 min postinfection. Site-specific
      introduction of the luciferase gene into the phage genome was
      achieved by homologous recombination in infected cells between a
      plasmid carrying A511 DNA flanking luxAB and phage DNA. Recombinants
      occurred in the lysate at a frequency of 5 x 10(-4) and were readily
      identified by the bioluminescent phenotype conferred on newly
      infected host cells. A511::luxAB can be used to directly detect
      Listeria cells. Following infection and a 2-h incubation period,
      numbers as low as 5 x 10(2) to 10(3) cells per mi were detected by
      using a single-tube luminometer. Extreme sensitivity was achieved by
      including an enrichment step prior to the lux phage assay; under
      these conditions less than 1 cell of L. monocytogenes Scott A per g
      of artificially contaminated salad was clearly identified. The assay
      is simple, rapid, inexpensive, and easy to perform. Our findings
      indicate that AS11::luxAB is useful for routine screening of foods
      and environmental samples for Listeria cells. [References: 37]

AB  - To determine the role of the FHIT gene, which encompasses the
      fragile site at 3p14.2, we analyzed 59 tumors of the small cell and
      non-small cell type by reverse transcription of FHIT mRNA, followed
      by PCR amplification and sequencing of products. Allelic losses
      affecting the gene were evaluated by microsatellite polymorphism
      analysis and genomic alterations by hybridization using cDNA and
      genomic probes. Small cell lung tumors (80%) and non-small cell lung
      cancers (40%) showed abnormalities in RNA transcripts of FHIT, and
      76% of the tumors exhibited loss of FHIT alleles. Abnormal lung
      tumor transcripts lack two or more exons of the FHIT gene. Small
      cell lung cancer tumors and cell lines were analyzed by Southern
      blotting and showed rearranged BamHI fragments. These data suggest a
      critical role of the FHIT gene in lung carcinogenesis. [References:

AB  - The cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4a) is inactivated in many human
      tumors and in families with hereditary melanoma and pancreatic
      cancer. Tumor-associated alterations in the INK4a locus may also
      affect the overlapping gene encoding p19(ARF) and the adjacent gene
      encoding p15(INK4b), both negative regulators of cell proliferation.
      We report the phenotype of mice carrying a targeted deletion of the
      INK4a locus that eliminates both p-16(INK4a) and p19(ARF). The mice
      are viable but develop spontaneous tumors at an early age and are
      highly sensitive to carcinogenic treatments. INK4a-deficient primary
      fibroblasts proliferate rapidly and have a high colony-formation
      efficiency. in contrast with normal cells, the introduction of
      activated Ha-ras into INK4a-deficient fibroblasts can result in
      neoplastic transformation. These findings directly demonstrate that
      the INK4a locus functions to suppress neoplastic growth.

AB  - CDC16 and CDC27 were identified as genes in S. cerevisiae necessary
      to limit DNA replication to once per cell cycle. A screen for
      mutants that overreplicated their DNA uncovered new conditional
      alleles that cause accumulation of up to 8C DNA. DNA overreplication
      involves all chromosomes and does not require passage through
      mitosis or another START. It occurs within a single cell cycle and
      can cause arrest at the MEC1 checkpoint. Remarkably, CIb2-Cdc28
      activity remains elevated in the overreplicating cells. These
      observations distinguish CDC16 and CDC27 from other mutants that
      accumulate extra DNA after completing an aberrent mitosis, or
      skipping mitosis altogether, and entering a second, inappropriate G1
      and S phase. CDC16 and CDC27 may contribute to replication control
      by targeted proteolysis of an S phase initiator. [References: 53]

AB  - Using a yeast one-hybrid screen with a DNA-bound Ets-1 protein, we
      have identified MafB, an AP-1 like protein, as a direct interaction
      partner. MafB is specifically expressed in myelomonocytic cells and
      binds to the DNA-binding domain of Ets-1 via its basic region or
      leucine-zipper domain. Furthermore, it represses Ets-1
      transactivation of synthetic promoters containing Ets binding sites
      and inhibits Ets-1-mediated transactivation of the transferrin
      receptor, which is known to be essential for erythroid
      differentiation, Accordingly, overexpression of MafB in an
      erythroblast cell line down-regulates the endogenous transferrin
      receptor gene and inhibits differentiation without affecting cell
      proliferation. These results highlight the importance of inhibitory
      interactions between transcription factors in regulating
      lineage-specific gene expression. [References: 79]

AB  - Expression of a constitutively active R-ras converted two cell lines
      that grow in suspension into highly adherent cells. There was little
      change in cell surface expression of integrins, but attachment to
      surfaces coated with the integrin ligands was greatly enhanced.
      Cells transfected with activated R-ras bound integrin ligands from
      solution with higher affinities and assembled severalfold more
      fibronectin matrix than control transfectants. Introduction of a
      dominant negative R-ras into adherent cells reduced the adhesiveness
      of the cells, indicating that endogenous R-ras can control the
      ligand-binding activity of integrins. These results provide a
      mechanism for the modulation of integrin ligand-binding activity as
      well as a novel function for R-ras. [References: 56]

AB  - E. coli preprotein translocase comprises SecA and a SecY/E/G
      complex. SecA delivers the preprotein to the putative
      protein-conducting channel formed by SecY/E by undergoing ATP-driven
      cycles of membrane insertion and deinsertion. SecG renders the
      translocase highly efficient. An antibody raised against the
      C-terminal region of SecG inhibits preprotein translocation into
      everted membrane vesicles despite the exposure of this region to the
      inside of membrane vesicles in the absence of preprotein
      translocation. When preprotein translocation was started with ATP
      and then blocked by the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis, the C-terminal
      region was exposed to the outside of membrane vesicles. Another
      region of SecG showed a change in membrane sidedness upon preprotein
      translocation, indicating that SecG undergoes topology inversion.
      This topology inversion was tightly coupled to the SecG function and
      linked with the insertion-deinsertion cycle of SecA. [References:

AB  - S. cerevisiae inherits its vacuole by projecting vacuole-derived
      membrane vesicles and tubules into the bud, where they fuse to
      establish the daughter vacuole. This homotypic fusion event can be
      assayed in vitro. It requires Sec17p and Sec18p, the homologs of the
      mammalian alpha-SNAP and NSF, which cooperate in multiple steps of
      membrane trafficking. We now report that Sec17p, Sec18p, and ATP are
      only needed for an early stage of the reaction that results in
      Sec17p release. Sec17p and Sec18p actions precede, and are needed
      for, the step employing the Ras-like GTPase Ypt7p. Sec18p-driven
      release of Sec17p can even precede vacuole docking, as it can occur
      prior to mixing of vacuoles and is insensitive to vacuole
      concentration. Sec17p and Sec18p thus may function in a predocking
      stage of the reaction, rather than in bilayer fusion per se.

AB  - In Drosophila imaginal wing discs, the achaete-scute (ac-sc)
      proneural genes and rhomboid (veinlet) are expressed in highly
      resolved patterns that prefigure the positions of sensory organs and
      wing veins, respectively. It is thought that these patterns are
      generated by a combination of factors (a prepattern) regulating
      these genes. We provide evidence for the existence of this
      prepattern by identifying two of its factors, Araucan and
      Caupolican. They are members of a novel family of homeoproteins,
      with homologs in vertebrates. Araucan and Caupolican, present in
      domains of the imaginal discs larger than those expressing as-sc and
      rhomboid, are necessary for expression of these genes in the
      overlapping domains. Araucan and Caupolican appear to be positive,
      direct regulators of ac-sc. [References: 51]

MH  - Mouse thymocytes.  Signals.  Dna
AB  - V(D)J recombination requires a pair of signal sequences with spacer
      lengths of 12 and 23 base pairs. Cleavage by the RAG1 and RAG2
      proteins was previously shown to demand only a single signal
      sequence. Here, we establish conditions where 12- and 23-spacer
      signal sequences are both necessary for cleavage. Coupled cutting at
      both sites requires only the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins, but depends on
      the metal ion. In Mn2+, a single signal sequence supports efficient
      double strand cleavage, but cutting in Mg2+ requires two signal
      sequences and is best with the canonical 12/23 pair. Thus, the RAG
      proteins determine both aspects of the specificity of V(D)J
      recombination, the recognition of a single signal sequence and the
      correct 12/23 coupling in a pair of signals. [References: 18]

AB  - A yeast gene homologous to bacterial RNase III (RNT1) encodes a

      synthesis. Two rRNA processing events are blocked in cells
      temperature sensitive for RNT1: cleavage at the snoRNA-dependent A0
      site in the 5' ETS and cleavage in the 3' ETS. Recombinant RNT1
      protein accurately cleaves a synthetic 5' ETS RNA at the AO site in
      vitro, in the absence of snoRNA or other factors. A synthetic 3' ETS
      substrate is specifically cleaved at a site 21 nt downstream of the
      3' end of 28S rRNA. These observations show that a protein
      endonuclease collaborates with snoRNAs in eukaryotic rRNA processing
      and exclude a catalytic role for snoRNAs at certain pre-rRNA
      cleavage sites. [References: 61]

AB  - Telomeres, the nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of eukaryotic
      chromosomes, are essential for chromosome stability. In the yeast S.
      cerevisiae, telomeric DNA is bound in a sequence-specific manner by
      RAP1, a multifunctional protein also involved in transcriptional
      regulation. Here we report the crystal structure of the DNA-binding
      domain of RAP1 in complex with a telomeric DNA site at 2.25 Angstrom
      resolution. The protein contains two similar domains that bind DNA
      in a tandem orientation, recognizing a tandemly repeated DNA
      sequence. The domains are structurally related to the homeodomain
      and the proto-oncogene Myb, but show novel features in their
      DNA-binding mode. A structured linker between the domains and a long
      C-terminal tail contribute to the binding specificity. This
      structure provides insight into the recognition of the conserved
      telomeric DNA sequences by a protein. [References: 64]

      increasingly influence aspects of diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy
      in clinical ophthalmology. Our current understanding of ocular
      pathophysiology and classification of eye disease will be advanced
      and challenged by new discoveries in molecular biology. A knowledge
      of genotype can clarify apparent phenotype. At the present time,
      diagnostic tests in ophthalmology for both acquired and inherited
      diseases are being revolutionized by molecular technology. The
      molecular genetics of ocular disease is currently the subject of
      intense investigation using techniques of gene mapping and
      isolation. Rapid progress in understanding the molecular basis of
      eye diseases will advance the treatment of these conditions,
      including the potential for gene therapy. [References: 63]

SO  - Human Genetics 1996 May;97(5):620-624
AB  - In order to contribute to the development of the transcriptional map
      of human chromosome 21 (HC21) we have used exon trapping to identify
      portions of HC21 genes, Using pools of random HC21-specific cosmids
      from the LL21NC02-Q Library and cosmids from 21q22.3 we have
      identified five different coding regions with strong homology to the
      lanosterol synthase genes of rat and yeast. This enzyme catalyzes
      the cyclization of squalene-2,3-epoxide to lanosterol, which is the
      parental compound of all steroids in mammals. Using somatic cell
      hybrids and HC21 yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) and cosmids, we
      mapped the human lanosterol synthase gene to 21q22.3 between markers
      D21S25 and 21qter. Cosmid Q7G8 from the LL21NC02-Q library and YAC
      145D8 from the CEPH HC21 contig contain this human gene. We cloned a
      portion of the human lanosterol synthase cDNA (almost 85% of the
      coding region) from a brain cDNA library and determined its
      nucleotide sequence. The predicted human protein shows 83% identity
      to its rat and 40% to its yeast homolog. No obvious candidate human
      disease exists for lanosterol synthase deficiency and the role (if
      any) of triplication of this gene in the various phenotypes of
      trisomy 21 is unknown. [References: 22]

AB  - Reciprocal translocations (rep) are among the most common
      constitutional chromosomal aberrations in man, Using a European
      database of 1574 families carrying autosomal rep, a cartographic
      study was done on the breakpoints involved. The breakpoints are
      non-randomly distributed along the different chromosomes, indicating
      ''hot spots''. Breakpoints of rep that result in descendants that
      are unbalanced chromosomally at birth are more frequent in a distal
      position on chromosomal arms, and 65% of them are localised in
      R-bands. Among the R-bands, bands rich in GC islands and poor in Alu
      repetitive sequences are more frequently the site of breakpoints, as
      well as bands that include a fragile site. This result suggests that
      the variation in degree of methylation in GC islands could be
      involved in chromosomal breakage and hence in chromosomal
      rearrangements. [References: 29]

AB  - Resealed human red cell membranes, ghosts, bind oleate (OL) by a
      limited number of sites when equilibrated al 37 degrees C, pH 7.3
      with OL bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) in molar ratios below
      1.5. The binding capacity is 34+/-2.2 nmol g(-1) ghosts with a
      dissociation equilibrium constant (37 degrees C) K-dm 1.38+/-0.15
      fold K-d of albumin binding. K-dm is temperature independent and
      similar to 7-8 nM.

      Exchange efflux kinetics at 0 degrees C to buffers of various
      albumin concentrations ([BSA(y)]) is biexponential and is analysed
      in terms of a three-compartment model. Accordingly the ratio of
      inner to outer membrane leaflet binding sites is 0.450+/-0.018 and
      the rate constant of unidirectional flux from inside to outside is
      0.067+/-0.01 s(-1). The rate constant of flux from the extracellular
      side of the membrane to BSA(y) increases with the square root of
      [BSA(y)] as expected of an unstirred layer effect. This provides an
      estimate of the dissociation rate constant of OL-BSA complex at 0
      degrees C of 0.0063+/-0.0003 s(-1).

      Exchange efflux from ghosts containing four different [BSA(i)] obeys
      the expected kinetics of a three-compartment approximation of the
      theoretical model. Accounting for the effect of an unstirred fluid
      inside ghosts, the rare coefficients fit the values predicted by the
      parameters obtained by the studies of albumin-free ghosts. The
      results show that the OL transport across the membrane is mediated
      exclusively by the asymmetrically distributed binding sites. The
      differences between transport sites of three long-chain fatty acids
      suggest that they are protein determined microdomains of
      phospholipids. [References: 41]

AB  - Background & Aims: Both androgenic and estrogenic steroids have been
      implicated in the development and course of several liver diseases,
      including hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to
      investigate temporal changes in hepatic estrogen and androgen
      receptors and hormone metabolism in a rat model of liver hyperplasia
      and carcinogenesis. Methods: Rats were fed hepatocarcinogenic
      peroxisome proliferator agents for 3 days to 10 months. Livers were
      examined for proliferation markers, activity and cellular
      distribution of sex steroid receptors, and key enzymes in sex
      hormone homeostasis. Results: At all times, liver weight and
      proliferation markers in treated rats were increased. Early exposure
      resulted in increased nuclear estrogen and androgen receptor
      activity in treated rats. Tumors that developed after 9-10 months
      showed a marked decrease in estrogen receptor activity and, in
      contrast, an increase in androgen receptor activity, as did liver
      surrounding the tumors. Both short-term and long-term exposure to
      the carcinogens resulted in dramatic reductions in steroid
      metabolism. Conclusions: This study supports the thesis that, in
      preneoplastic stages such as hyperplasia, there is an elevation of
      both receptor activities and that the progression from hyperplasia
      to cancer results in suppression of estrogen receptor expression but
      maintenance of androgen receptor. [References: 55]

AB  - Colonic mucosal proliferation, aberrant crypt foci (ACF) induction,
      and fecal bile acids, parameters connected to the risk of colon
      cancer development, were studied in female F344 rats treated with
      starch or sucrose boluses or with a sucrose diet.

      Cell proliferation was higher in animals treated with a single
      sucrose bolus than in those given a starch bolus (15 g/kg body wt),
      with 4.3 +/- 0.64 and 2.17 +/- 0.57 (SE) mitotic figures (MF) per
      crypt in the sucrose and starch bolus groups, respectively (p <
      0.01). When azoxymethane (AOM, 20 mg/kg) was administered 24 hours
      after a single sucrose or star ch bolus, the number of ACF per colon
      after 30 days was higher in the sucrose bolus group [107.5 +/- 9.5
      (SE)] than in the starch bolus group (67.8 +/- 0.9, p < 0.01). In
      additional experiments, colon cell proliferation (MF/crypt) was
      higher in rats given boluses of sucrose three times per week for 40
      days after AOM (20 mg/kg) [5.9 +/- 0.7 (SE)] than in rats given
      starch boluses (2.96 +/- 0.4) or fed sucrose continuously (3.6 +/-
      0.5). On the contrary, after 40 days of dietary treatment, the
      number, dimension, and percentage of ACF secreting sulfomucins and
      sialomucins were not varied among these three groups. However, the
      percentage of ''large ACF'' (ACF with greater than or equal to 4
      crypts) secreting sialomucins or predominantly sialomucins was
      higher (p < 0.05) in the sucrose bolus group than in the starch
      group. The concentration of fecal bile acids and long-chain fatty
      acids was the same in the sucrose and starch groups, but the
      concentrations of deoxycholic and oleic acid were significantly
      higher in the sucrose bolus group. In conclusion, the administration
      of sucrose as a bolus had a stronger effect than continuous sucrose
      feeding on some parameters related to colon carcinogenesis and might
      be considered a risk factor in colon carcinogenesis. [References:

MH  - Fibrositis
AB  - Objective. To ascertain the long-term natural history of
      fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).

      Methods. Patients with a history of FMS, seen in an academic
      rheumatology referral practice, were originally surveyed soon after
      onset of symptoms, and then were reinterviewed 10 years later in a
      prospective followup cohort study. A validated telephone survey was
      administered that inquired into current symptoms, medical care and
      treatments used, and work disability. The results were compared with
      the prior surveys.

      Results. Of the original 39 patients, there were 4 deaths. Of the
      remaining 35 patients, 29 (83%) were reinterviewed. Mean age at
      current survey was 55 years, and mean duration of symptoms was 15.8
      years. All patients had persistence of some fibromyalgia symptoms,
      although almost half (48%) had not seen a doctor for them in the
      last year. Moderate to severe pain or stiffness was reported in 55%
      of patients; moderate to a lot of sleep difficulty was noted in 48%;
      and moderate to extreme fatigue was noted in 59%. These symptoms
      showed little change from earlier surveys. In 79% of patients,
      medications were still being taken to control FMS symptoms. Despite
      continuing symptoms, 66% of patients reported that FMS symptoms were
      a little or a lot better than when first diagnosed. Fifty-five
      percent of patients said they felt well or very well in terms of FMS
      symptoms, and only 7% felt they were doing poorly, With the
      exception of sleep trouble, which was persistent, baseline survey
      symptoms correlated poorly with symptoms at the 10-year followup.

      Conclusion. FMS symptoms last, on average, at least 15 years after
      illness onset. However, most patients experience some improvement in
      symptoms after FMS onset. [References: 12]

MH  - Dietary copper.  Fiber.  Zinc.  Cholesterol.  Magnesium.  Transport.
      Jejunum.  Milk
AB  - The absorption of some minerals has been shown to be affected by the
      presence of unhydrolyzed dietary triglycerides and free fatty acids
      generated from their partial hydrolysis, Since copper (Cu) can form
      poorly soluble soaps with long-chain fatty acids, we examined
      whether the uptake of Cu from the intestinal lumen is altered by the
      presence of fatty acids and triglycerides using an in vivo jejunal
      perfusion procedure, Long-chain fatty acids palmitate and stearate
      at 1.0 mM reduced Cu absorption rates compared with infusates
      without either fatty acid or triglycerides (means +/- SEM, controls:
      104.4 +/- 8.8 pmole/min x cm vs palmitate: 12.5 +/- 17.6, P <
      0.01;stearate: 37.2 +/- 25.6, P < 0.05). Medium chain free fatty
      acids had no effect on Cu absorption (caprylate: 90.6 +/- 14.9, not
      significant; caproate: 69.5 +/- 14.2, not significant), Similarly,
      neither an emulsion of medium chain nor long-chain triglycerides at
      a total 1.0 or 2.5 mM concentration altered Cu absorption, The
      inhibitory effect of palmitate and stearate on Cu absorption was
      accompanied by a reduction in lumen-to-mucosa water influx
      (controls: 5.33 +/- 0.26 mu l/min x cm vs palmitate: 3.20 +/- 0.70,
      P < 0.01; stearate: 3.36 +/- 0.52, P < 0.01). The data are
      consistent with a potential impairment of Cu intestinal absorption
      by long-chain free fatty acids which may accumulate in the jejunum
      following excessive fat intake and/or lipid malabsorption.

AB  - During early embryogenesis of Drosophila the spatial and temporal
      expression patterns of the region-specific homeotic gene spalt (sal)
      and the neighbouring gene spalt adjacent (sala) extensively overlap.
      We show that the initial expression patterns of the two genes in the
      blastoderm also have identical genetic contols. However, while sal
      encodes a transcription factor, sala encodes a precursor protein
      from which a functional signal peptide is cleaved off to generate
      the secreted sala protein. Ectopic expression or absence of sala
      protein does not affect embryonic development, adult viability or
      fertility. In addition to sal and sala, we identified a third gene
      nearby, termed spalt related (salr), which shares coding sequence
      similarity and a late embryonic expression pattern with sal, but
      lacks the early expression domains that are shared by sal and sala.
      These results suggest that the three genes and their present
      cis-regulatory regions arose through a chromosomal rearrangement
      involving local duplication and transposition events in the 32F/33A
      region on the left arm of the second chromosome. [References: 43]
