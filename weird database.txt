Thank you very much for your prompt reply!!  I should have explained more about what I 
tried, sorry.  I downloaded files via the internet from the library, so it is already 
converted to MSDOS format by the mailer software in my PC, I think.  The server in the 
library may be a UNIX machine, I tried UNIX2DOS.COM < MYFILE > OUTPUT, which attouch 
the CTRL-M at the end of the lines, but it did not contribute at all to make my file 
read by REFS.  Please take a look of the next sample file.  It has a tagged format as 
you expected.  Each field is started with 2 letter marker followed by 2 spaces, which 
I can search and replace with WORD or EXCEL into %A space or anything you design.  The 
problem is NOT the end of each line but the marker of the end of each record.  In this 
file it is delimited return-return-ZZ-return.  If I import this file as a MEDLINE 
format, abstract(except the last record), year and pages appear in correct windows, 
but others do not.  If I try REF format, all the fields other than abstract come out 
in the abstract window.  I tried editing refer.flt to change '%%A %S' to '%PA %S", but 
it made no change.  Those are all I tried.  Thank you very much for taking your time 
to do this boring job.  I look forward to hearing from you again.  

Sincerely yours,
Shugo Suwazono

AB  In order to determine the neurophysiological characteristics of
    HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP)
    throughout the world, we analyzed and compared the most common clinical
    neurophysiological studies (CNPS) performed in this entity from those
    places with a high prevalence and interesting regional differences were
    noted. (skip) Such differences could likely be due to the action of the
    so-called environmental co-factors present in each of these areas which
    should be promptly investigated

AB  A morphological filter for single sweep records of event-related potential
    (ERP) obtained in an auditory oddball paradigm, especially P300 waveform,
    was constructed. By combining four basic operations; erosion, dilation,
    opening and closing, we could derive a desired filter whose properties fit
    the current objectives. (skip)
